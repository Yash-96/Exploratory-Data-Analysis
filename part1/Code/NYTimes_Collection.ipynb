              "'Advertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy\\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.\\nA year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.\\nThe result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.\\nBut critics saw few systemic changes.\\n“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.\\nA history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.\\n“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”\\nAnd that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.\\nStudents in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.\\nSmith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)\\nMore righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.\\nHis class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.\\n“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.\\nSmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.\\nWhile Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.\\n“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”\\nSmith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.\\nWithin three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.\\nThat summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.\\nSmith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)\\n“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.\\nSmith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.\\nSouthall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.\\n“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.\\nTo hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”\\n“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”\\nAlly Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”\\nHer days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.\\n“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”\\nStill, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy The Associated Press\\nTiger Woods\\' win at the Masters is still a hot topic.\\n PodcastOne Sports Now hosts Jim Litke and Tim Dahlberg look back at the memorable moment that transcended the sports world.

One reason? Examples like Tunica, Miss.\\nBy Timothy Williams\\nTUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. \\nWhen Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. \\nBut in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.\\nThen last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. \\nThe vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. \\nThe reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.\\n“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.\\nSince the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.\\nIn all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.\\nWest Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.\\nRhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.\\nNew Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. \\nThe nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.\\nTribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.\\nA year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.\\nThe area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. \\nAlong Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.\\nBefore casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.\\nBut legalized gambling brought change. \\nCotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.\\nEarly on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.\\nAt the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.\\nBut within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. \\nAs the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.\\nThe effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.\\nSome residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.\\nMr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.\\n“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” \\nSports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.\\nBut in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.\\nSo far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.\\nIn all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.\\n“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.\\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. \\nPete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.\\n“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. \\n \\nR. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.\\n“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”\\nMany gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.\\n“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said. He sighed, and for a moment, his optimism dissolved. “That’s a real challenge.”\\nAn earlier version of this story misstated which year the Tunica area\\'s largest casino, Harrah\\'s Tunica, closed.

That for too long the federations have not done right by them to protect them and empower them,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s an exciting moment to see that happening.\" \\nClosing the pay gap between male and female athletes is critical to attracting women to professional sports, which will in turn boost the popularity of women\\'s sports leagues, he said.\\nWomen would no longer accept being treated as second class citizens by their sports, he said, and will demand a greater share of the overall wealth it generates going forward.\\n\"The WNBA survives and it has been great to see it survive but women who play in the WNBA have to cobble together jobs in Europe in between,\" he said. \\n\"We have to step up as a society and say this matters and that men and women should be on as equal a footing as we can be.\" \\nThe next generation of woman athletes will be better served if they can see similarities between themselves, their coaches and the sports icons they look up to, U.S. gold medalist gymnast Laurie Hernandez said at the Women Coach LA launch event. \\n\"I took it as a really big responsibility to be a role model for these kids,\" she told a gathering of about 400 women at the kickoff for the initiative, which is a partnership between the City of LA and Nike.\\n\"Growing up I didn\\'t see many, if any, Hispanic gymnasts and I just resorted to being my own person,\" she said.\\n\"I guess I didn\\'t realize how big of a deal it was to be a Hispanic American on the Olympic team because then so many little girls started becoming gymnasts,\" she said. \\n\"And it\\'s because they saw someone that looked like them.\" \\n (Reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Nick Mulvenney)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy and Billy Witz\\nThey are sports that bring in little in the way of money or notoriety or attention compared with the behemoths, football and basketball.\\nIn college athletics, volleyball, water polo, sailing, tennis and soccer are relatively small-time affairs that don’t fill stadiums or drive billion-dollar media contracts, and that is why they are at the center of what was described as the broadest college admissions fraud the Justice Department has uncovered.\\nJust like the high-profile sports like football and basketball, coaches in the so-called Olympic sports are generally allowed to reserve several slots each year for students who might not otherwise gain admission. These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.\\nThe Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.\\nUnlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.\\nThat is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.\\n[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.]\\nIn short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”\\nThe water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.\\nThe practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.\\nStanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.\\nFederal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.\\nAt the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.\\nAccording to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.\\nKathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”\\nEven fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”\\nMeghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.\\nAt U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.\\nThe coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.\\nHe told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”\\nA month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.\\nAccording to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.\\nStanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.\\n“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”\\nNo school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.\\nSinger is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.\\nThe central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July. She was fired Tuesday.\\nThe school’s water polo coach, Vavic, is accused of accepting $250,000 from Singer after two students were admitted as water polo players. Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.\\nAli Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.\\nWake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.\\nIn a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. It is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”\\nThe case is only the latest to rock U.S.C. The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.\\nProsecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.\\n“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.\\n“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.\\nLater, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”\\n“But she’s not,” Huneeus said.\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the profession of William Singer. He worked in the college counseling business; he is not an intellectual property lawyer.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Joe Drape\\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lisa Kerney once earned her living hosting “SportsCenter” on ESPN, making her a nightly fixture in the vast American conversation between sports fans and their favorite athletes, teams and leagues. Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American.\\nEvery Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor’s chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios.\\nShe will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.’s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states.\\nBy next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.\\n“Now fans are able to play the game within the game,” Kerney said. “It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who’s going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”\\nLast May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.\\nOn the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.\\nOn the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.\\n“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”\\nAs sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.\\nFigures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.\\nLegalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.\\nIn two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.\\nThe Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.\\nLast year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.\\nAt the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.\\n“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”\\nThe Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.\\nMillman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.\\n“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”\\nFor now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.\\n“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”\\nKerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.\\nWith a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years.\\n“The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don’t have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,” Kerney said. “We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.”\\nYou can follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nRemembering Mel Stottlemyre, Don Newcombe, King Kong Bundy and many others who died this year.\\nMarilynn Smith, 89\\nAn LPGA Founder and Champion\\nHarry Howell, 86\\nRangers Defenseman\\nJulia Ruth Stevens, 102\\nBabe Ruth’s Daughter\\nEusebio Pedroza, \\nFeatherweight Boxer\\nKing Kong Bundy, 63\\nProfessional Wrestler\\nTed Lindsay, 93\\nDetroit Red Wings Star\\nDon Newcombe, 92\\nBarrier‑Breaking Dodgers Pitcher\\nGene Littler, 88\\nGolfer With a Gorgeous Swing\\nFrank Robinson, 83\\nBaseball\\'s First Black Manager\\nBob Friend, 88\\nYankee‑Defeating Pirate Pitcher\\nFred Thompson, 85\\nChampion of Women in Track and Field\\nJohn Coughlin, 33\\nSkating Champion\\nMel Stottlemyre, 77\\nYankees\\' Ace\\nProduced by Daniel E.

Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.\\n“Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”\\n— Billie Jean King, a tennis legend who led the charge for pay equality in her sport\\nLast week, all 28 players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team — the greatest women’s soccer team in the world — filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, another move in its long-running battle for equality.\\nThe athletes — including the stars Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd — are not just taking issue with their paychecks but also with where they play, how they travel to matches, and the medical treatment and coaching they receive, in what they called “institutionalized gender discrimination,” as my colleague Andy Das reported.\\n“We’ve always, dating back to forever, been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place,” Rapinoe told The New York Times on Friday.\\nThe women’s team holds a record three World Cup championships and four Olympic gold medals.\\n[READ MORE: U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination]\\nThe issue of pay inequality in sports is of course not just soccer’s problem. Women across all sports are paid less, and many have fought for equity in salary and in prize money. \\nHere are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.\\nThe U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.\\n[READ MORE: Eight Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality]\\nThe Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men’s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women’s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women\\'s Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\\nThe W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000. The minimum starting salary for N.B.A. players is about $580,000.\\nLast summer, A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the No. 1 overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, commented on LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “Must be nice. We over here looking for an M but Lord, let me get back in my lane,” she tweeted. Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, is expected to earn $6.8 million in his first year.\\nU.S.A. Hockey. In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey did not increase the women’s wages. The risk paid off. Within days, the team and U.S.A. Hockey reached a four-year deal that gave the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time.\\nSign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox!\\n______\\nHere are five articles from The Times you might have missed.\\n“My passion has been taken away.” A midwife who has delivered hundreds of babies for Mennonite women is facing felony charges for practicing without the proper license.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”\\nWhen Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”\\nMs. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. \\nBefore finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).\\nIn a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).\\nThe good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)\\nMs. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”\\nWhen possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.\\nAlthough many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.\\nAfter measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.\\nSports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.\\nEncapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.\\nCombination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.\\nSome more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.\\nHook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.\\nMost of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.\\nMove on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.\\nIf you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).\\nLook for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.\\nSign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday. \\nA version of this article appears at Wirecutter.com.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Reuters\\n(Reuters) - Billionaire Mike Ashley\\'s Sports Direct said it did not intend to make an offer to buy Debenhams after lenders took control of the ailing retailer on Tuesday.\\nSports Direct had until April 22 to make a firm offer for the retailer or walk away under British takeover rules.\\nDebenhams was locked in a long-running battle for control with its largest shareholder, Ashley\\'s Sports Direct.\\n (Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy\\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.\\nA year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.\\nThe result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.\\nBut critics saw few systemic changes.\\n“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.\\nA history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.\\n“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”\\nAnd that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.\\nStudents in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.\\nSmith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)\\nMore righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.\\nHis class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.\\n“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.\\nSmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.\\nWhile Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.\\n“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”\\nSmith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.\\nWithin three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.\\nThat summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.\\nSmith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)\\n“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.\\nSmith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.\\nSouthall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.\\n“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.\\nTo hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”\\n“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”\\nAlly Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”\\nHer days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.\\n“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”\\nStill, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy The Associated Press\\nTiger Woods\\' win at the Masters is still a hot topic.\\n PodcastOne Sports Now hosts Jim Litke and Tim Dahlberg look back at the memorable moment that transcended the sports world.

One reason? Examples like Tunica, Miss.\\nBy Timothy Williams\\nTUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. \\nWhen Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. \\nBut in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.\\nThen last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. \\nThe vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. \\nThe reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.\\n“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.\\nSince the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.\\nIn all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.\\nWest Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.\\nRhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.\\nNew Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. \\nThe nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.\\nTribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.\\nA year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.\\nThe area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. \\nAlong Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.\\nBefore casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.\\nBut legalized gambling brought change. \\nCotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.\\nEarly on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.\\nAt the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.\\nBut within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. \\nAs the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.\\nThe effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.\\nSome residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.\\nMr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.\\n“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” \\nSports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.\\nBut in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.\\nSo far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.\\nIn all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.\\n“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.\\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. \\nPete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.\\n“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. \\n \\nR. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.\\n“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”\\nMany gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.\\n“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said. He sighed, and for a moment, his optimism dissolved. “That’s a real challenge.”\\nAn earlier version of this story misstated which year the Tunica area\\'s largest casino, Harrah\\'s Tunica, closed.

That for too long the federations have not done right by them to protect them and empower them,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s an exciting moment to see that happening.\" \\nClosing the pay gap between male and female athletes is critical to attracting women to professional sports, which will in turn boost the popularity of women\\'s sports leagues, he said.\\nWomen would no longer accept being treated as second class citizens by their sports, he said, and will demand a greater share of the overall wealth it generates going forward.\\n\"The WNBA survives and it has been great to see it survive but women who play in the WNBA have to cobble together jobs in Europe in between,\" he said. \\n\"We have to step up as a society and say this matters and that men and women should be on as equal a footing as we can be.\" \\nThe next generation of woman athletes will be better served if they can see similarities between themselves, their coaches and the sports icons they look up to, U.S. gold medalist gymnast Laurie Hernandez said at the Women Coach LA launch event. \\n\"I took it as a really big responsibility to be a role model for these kids,\" she told a gathering of about 400 women at the kickoff for the initiative, which is a partnership between the City of LA and Nike.\\n\"Growing up I didn\\'t see many, if any, Hispanic gymnasts and I just resorted to being my own person,\" she said.\\n\"I guess I didn\\'t realize how big of a deal it was to be a Hispanic American on the Olympic team because then so many little girls started becoming gymnasts,\" she said. \\n\"And it\\'s because they saw someone that looked like them.\" \\n (Reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Nick Mulvenney)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy and Billy Witz\\nThey are sports that bring in little in the way of money or notoriety or attention compared with the behemoths, football and basketball.\\nIn college athletics, volleyball, water polo, sailing, tennis and soccer are relatively small-time affairs that don’t fill stadiums or drive billion-dollar media contracts, and that is why they are at the center of what was described as the broadest college admissions fraud the Justice Department has uncovered.\\nJust like the high-profile sports like football and basketball, coaches in the so-called Olympic sports are generally allowed to reserve several slots each year for students who might not otherwise gain admission. These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.\\nThe Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.\\nUnlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.\\nThat is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.\\n[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.]\\nIn short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”\\nThe water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.\\nThe practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.\\nStanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.\\nFederal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.\\nAt the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.\\nAccording to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.\\nKathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”\\nEven fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”\\nMeghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.\\nAt U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.\\nThe coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.\\nHe told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”\\nA month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.\\nAccording to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.\\nStanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.\\n“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”\\nNo school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.\\nSinger is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.\\nThe central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July.

Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.\\nAli Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.\\nWake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.\\nIn a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again.

The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.\\nProsecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.\\n“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.\\n“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.\\nLater, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”\\n“But she’s not,” Huneeus said.\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the profession of William Singer.

Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American.\\nEvery Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor’s chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios.\\nShe will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.’s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states.\\nBy next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.\\n“Now fans are able to play the game within the game,” Kerney said. “It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who’s going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”\\nLast May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.\\nOn the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.\\nOn the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.\\n“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”\\nAs sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.\\nFigures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.\\nLegalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.\\nIn two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.\\nThe Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.\\nLast year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.\\nAt the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.\\n“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”\\nThe Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.\\nMillman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.\\n“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”\\nFor now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.\\n“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”\\nKerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.\\nWith a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years.\\n“The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don’t have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,” Kerney said. “We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.”\\nYou can follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nRemembering Mel Stottlemyre, Don Newcombe, King Kong Bundy and many others who died this year.\\nMarilynn Smith, 89\\nAn LPGA Founder and Champion\\nHarry Howell, 86\\nRangers Defenseman\\nJulia Ruth Stevens, 102\\nBabe Ruth’s Daughter\\nEusebio Pedroza, \\nFeatherweight Boxer\\nKing Kong Bundy, 63\\nProfessional Wrestler\\nTed Lindsay, 93\\nDetroit Red Wings Star\\nDon Newcombe, 92\\nBarrier‑Breaking Dodgers Pitcher\\nGene Littler, 88\\nGolfer With a Gorgeous Swing\\nFrank Robinson, 83\\nBaseball\\'s First Black Manager\\nBob Friend, 88\\nYankee‑Defeating Pirate Pitcher\\nFred Thompson, 85\\nChampion of Women in Track and Field\\nJohn Coughlin, 33\\nSkating Champion\\nMel Stottlemyre, 77\\nYankees\\' Ace\\nProduced by Daniel E.

Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.\\n“Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”\\n— Billie Jean King, a tennis legend who led the charge for pay equality in her sport\\nLast week, all 28 players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team — the greatest women’s soccer team in the world — filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, another move in its long-running battle for equality.\\nThe athletes — including the stars Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd — are not just taking issue with their paychecks but also with where they play, how they travel to matches, and the medical treatment and coaching they receive, in what they called “institutionalized gender discrimination,” as my colleague Andy Das reported.\\n“We’ve always, dating back to forever, been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place,” Rapinoe told The New York Times on Friday.\\nThe women’s team holds a record three World Cup championships and four Olympic gold medals.\\n[READ MORE: U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination]\\nThe issue of pay inequality in sports is of course not just soccer’s problem. Women across all sports are paid less, and many have fought for equity in salary and in prize money. \\nHere are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.\\nThe U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.\\n[READ MORE: Eight Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality]\\nThe Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men’s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women’s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women\\'s Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\\nThe W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000. The minimum starting salary for N.B.A. players is about $580,000.\\nLast summer, A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the No. 1 overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, commented on LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “Must be nice. We over here looking for an M but Lord, let me get back in my lane,” she tweeted. Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, is expected to earn $6.8 million in his first year.\\nU.S.A. Hockey. In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey did not increase the women’s wages. The risk paid off. Within days, the team and U.S.A. Hockey reached a four-year deal that gave the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time.\\nSign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox!\\n______\\nHere are five articles from The Times you might have missed.\\n“My passion has been taken away.” A midwife who has delivered hundreds of babies for Mennonite women is facing felony charges for practicing without the proper license.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”\\nWhen Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”\\nMs. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. \\nBefore finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).\\nIn a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).\\nThe good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)\\nMs. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”\\nWhen possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.\\nAlthough many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.\\nAfter measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.\\nSports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.\\nEncapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.\\nCombination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.\\nSome more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.\\nHook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.\\nMost of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.\\nMove on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.\\nIf you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).\\nLook for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.\\nSign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday. \\nA version of this article appears at Wirecutter.com.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Reuters\\n(Reuters) - Billionaire Mike Ashley\\'s Sports Direct said it did not intend to make an offer to buy Debenhams after lenders took control of the ailing retailer on Tuesday.\\nSports Direct had until April 22 to make a firm offer for the retailer or walk away under British takeover rules.\\nDebenhams was locked in a long-running battle for control with its largest shareholder, Ashley\\'s Sports Direct.\\n (Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy\\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.\\nA year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.\\nThe result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.\\nBut critics saw few systemic changes.\\n“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.\\nA history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.\\n“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”\\nAnd that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.\\nStudents in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.\\nSmith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)\\nMore righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.\\nHis class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.\\n“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.\\nSmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.\\nWhile Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.\\n“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”\\nSmith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.\\nWithin three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.\\nThat summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.\\nSmith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)\\n“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.\\nSmith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.\\nSouthall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.\\n“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.\\nTo hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”\\n“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”\\nAlly Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”\\nHer days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.\\n“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”\\nStill, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course.

One reason? Examples like Tunica, Miss.\\nBy Timothy Williams\\nTUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. \\nWhen Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. \\nBut in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.\\nThen last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. \\nThe vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. \\nThe reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.\\n“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.\\nSince the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.\\nIn all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.\\nWest Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.\\nRhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.\\nNew Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. \\nThe nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.\\nTribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.\\nA year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.\\nThe area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. \\nAlong Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.\\nBefore casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.\\nBut legalized gambling brought change. \\nCotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.\\nEarly on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.\\nAt the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.\\nBut within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. \\nAs the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.\\nThe effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.\\nSome residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.\\nMr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.\\n“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” \\nSports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.\\nBut in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.\\nSo far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.\\nIn all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.\\n“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.\\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. \\nPete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.\\n“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. \\n \\nR. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.\\n“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”\\nMany gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.\\n“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said. He sighed, and for a moment, his optimism dissolved. “That’s a real challenge.”\\nAn earlier version of this story misstated which year the Tunica area\\'s largest casino, Harrah\\'s Tunica, closed.

That for too long the federations have not done right by them to protect them and empower them,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s an exciting moment to see that happening.\" \\nClosing the pay gap between male and female athletes is critical to attracting women to professional sports, which will in turn boost the popularity of women\\'s sports leagues, he said.\\nWomen would no longer accept being treated as second class citizens by their sports, he said, and will demand a greater share of the overall wealth it generates going forward.\\n\"The WNBA survives and it has been great to see it survive but women who play in the WNBA have to cobble together jobs in Europe in between,\" he said. \\n\"We have to step up as a society and say this matters and that men and women should be on as equal a footing as we can be.\" \\nThe next generation of woman athletes will be better served if they can see similarities between themselves, their coaches and the sports icons they look up to, U.S. gold medalist gymnast Laurie Hernandez said at the Women Coach LA launch event. \\n\"I took it as a really big responsibility to be a role model for these kids,\" she told a gathering of about 400 women at the kickoff for the initiative, which is a partnership between the City of LA and Nike.\\n\"Growing up I didn\\'t see many, if any, Hispanic gymnasts and I just resorted to being my own person,\" she said.\\n\"I guess I didn\\'t realize how big of a deal it was to be a Hispanic American on the Olympic team because then so many little girls started becoming gymnasts,\" she said. \\n\"And it\\'s because they saw someone that looked like them.\" \\n (Reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Nick Mulvenney)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy and Billy Witz\\nThey are sports that bring in little in the way of money or notoriety or attention compared with the behemoths, football and basketball.\\nIn college athletics, volleyball, water polo, sailing, tennis and soccer are relatively small-time affairs that don’t fill stadiums or drive billion-dollar media contracts, and that is why they are at the center of what was described as the broadest college admissions fraud the Justice Department has uncovered.\\nJust like the high-profile sports like football and basketball, coaches in the so-called Olympic sports are generally allowed to reserve several slots each year for students who might not otherwise gain admission. These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.\\nThe Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.\\nUnlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.\\nThat is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.\\n[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.]\\nIn short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”\\nThe water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.\\nThe practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.\\nStanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.\\nFederal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.\\nAt the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.\\nAccording to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.\\nKathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”\\nEven fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”\\nMeghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.\\nAt U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.\\nThe coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.\\nHe told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”\\nA month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.\\nAccording to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.\\nStanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.\\n“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”\\nNo school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.\\nSinger is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.\\nThe central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July. She was fired Tuesday.\\nThe school’s water polo coach, Vavic, is accused of accepting $250,000 from Singer after two students were admitted as water polo players. Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.\\nAli Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.\\nWake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.\\nIn a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. It is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”\\nThe case is only the latest to rock U.S.C. The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.\\nProsecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.\\n“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.\\n“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.\\nLater, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”\\n“But she’s not,” Huneeus said.\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the profession of William Singer. He worked in the college counseling business; he is not an intellectual property lawyer.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Joe Drape\\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lisa Kerney once earned her living hosting “SportsCenter” on ESPN, making her a nightly fixture in the vast American conversation between sports fans and their favorite athletes, teams and leagues. Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American.\\nEvery Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor’s chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios.\\nShe will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.’s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states.\\nBy next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.\\n“Now fans are able to play the game within the game,” Kerney said. “It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who’s going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”\\nLast May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.\\nOn the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.\\nOn the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.\\n“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”\\nAs sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.\\nFigures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.\\nLegalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.\\nIn two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.\\nThe Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.\\nLast year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.\\nAt the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.\\n“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”\\nThe Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.\\nMillman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.\\n“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”\\nFor now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.\\n“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”\\nKerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.\\nWith a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years.\\n“The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don’t have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,” Kerney said. “We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.”\\nYou can follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nRemembering Mel Stottlemyre, Don Newcombe, King Kong Bundy and many others who died this year.\\nMarilynn Smith, 89\\nAn LPGA Founder and Champion\\nHarry Howell, 86\\nRangers Defenseman\\nJulia Ruth Stevens, 102\\nBabe Ruth’s Daughter\\nEusebio Pedroza, \\nFeatherweight Boxer\\nKing Kong Bundy, 63\\nProfessional Wrestler\\nTed Lindsay, 93\\nDetroit Red Wings Star\\nDon Newcombe, 92\\nBarrier‑Breaking Dodgers Pitcher\\nGene Littler, 88\\nGolfer With a Gorgeous Swing\\nFrank Robinson, 83\\nBaseball\\'s First Black Manager\\nBob Friend, 88\\nYankee‑Defeating Pirate Pitcher\\nFred Thompson, 85\\nChampion of Women in Track and Field\\nJohn Coughlin, 33\\nSkating Champion\\nMel Stottlemyre, 77\\nYankees\\' Ace\\nProduced by Daniel E.

Women across all sports are paid less, and many have fought for equity in salary and in prize money. \\nHere are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.\\nThe U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.\\n[READ MORE: Eight Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality]\\nThe Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men’s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women’s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women\\'s Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\\nThe W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000. The minimum starting salary for N.B.A. players is about $580,000.\\nLast summer, A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the No. 1 overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, commented on LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “Must be nice. We over here looking for an M but Lord, let me get back in my lane,” she tweeted. Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, is expected to earn $6.8 million in his first year.\\nU.S.A. Hockey. In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey did not increase the women’s wages. The risk paid off. Within days, the team and U.S.A. Hockey reached a four-year deal that gave the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time.\\nSign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox!\\n______\\nHere are five articles from The Times you might have missed.\\n“My passion has been taken away.” A midwife who has delivered hundreds of babies for Mennonite women is facing felony charges for practicing without the proper license.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”\\nWhen Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”\\nMs. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. \\nBefore finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).\\nIn a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).\\nThe good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)\\nMs. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”\\nWhen possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.\\nAlthough many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.\\nAfter measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.\\nSports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.\\nEncapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.\\nCombination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.\\nSome more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.\\nHook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.\\nMost of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.\\nMove on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.\\nIf you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).\\nLook for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.\\nSign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday. \\nA version of this article appears at Wirecutter.com.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Reuters\\n(Reuters) - Billionaire Mike Ashley\\'s Sports Direct said it did not intend to make an offer to buy Debenhams after lenders took control of the ailing retailer on Tuesday.\\nSports Direct had until April 22 to make a firm offer for the retailer or walk away under British takeover rules.\\nDebenhams was locked in a long-running battle for control with its largest shareholder, Ashley\\'s Sports Direct.\\n (Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy\\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.\\nA year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.\\nThe result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.\\nBut critics saw few systemic changes.\\n“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.\\nA history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.\\n“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”\\nAnd that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.\\nStudents in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.\\nSmith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)\\nMore righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.\\nHis class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.\\n“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.\\nSmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.\\nWhile Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.\\n“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”\\nSmith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.\\nWithin three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.\\nThat summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.\\nSmith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)\\n“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.\\nSmith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.\\nSouthall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.\\n“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.\\nTo hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”\\n“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”\\nAlly Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”\\nHer days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.\\n“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”\\nStill, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy The Associated Press\\nTiger Woods\\' win at the Masters is still a hot topic.\\n PodcastOne Sports Now hosts Jim Litke and Tim Dahlberg look back at the memorable moment that transcended the sports world.

One reason? Examples like Tunica, Miss.\\nBy Timothy Williams\\nTUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. \\nWhen Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. \\nBut in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.\\nThen last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. \\nThe vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. \\nThe reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.\\n“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.\\nSince the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.\\nIn all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.\\nWest Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.\\nRhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.\\nNew Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. \\nThe nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.\\nTribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.\\nA year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.\\nThe area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. \\nAlong Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.\\nBefore casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.\\nBut legalized gambling brought change. \\nCotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.\\nEarly on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.\\nAt the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.\\nBut within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. \\nAs the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.\\nThe effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.\\nSome residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.\\nMr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.\\n“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” \\nSports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.\\nBut in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.\\nSo far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.\\nIn all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.\\n“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.\\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. \\nPete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.\\n“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. \\n \\nR. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.\\n“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”\\nMany gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.\\n“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said. He sighed, and for a moment, his optimism dissolved. “That’s a real challenge.”\\nAn earlier version of this story misstated which year the Tunica area\\'s largest casino, Harrah\\'s Tunica, closed.

These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.\\nThe Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.\\nUnlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.\\nThat is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.\\n[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.]\\nIn short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”\\nThe water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.\\nThe practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.\\nStanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.\\nFederal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.\\nAt the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.\\nAccording to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.\\nKathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”\\nEven fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”\\nMeghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.\\nAt U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.\\nThe coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.\\nHe told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”\\nA month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.\\nAccording to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.\\nStanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.\\n“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”\\nNo school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.\\nSinger is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.\\nThe central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July. She was fired Tuesday.\\nThe school’s water polo coach, Vavic, is accused of accepting $250,000 from Singer after two students were admitted as water polo players. Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.\\nAli Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.\\nWake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.\\nIn a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. It is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”\\nThe case is only the latest to rock U.S.C. The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.\\nProsecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.\\n“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.\\n“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.\\nLater, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”\\n“But she’s not,” Huneeus said.\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the profession of William Singer. He worked in the college counseling business; he is not an intellectual property lawyer.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Joe Drape\\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lisa Kerney once earned her living hosting “SportsCenter” on ESPN, making her a nightly fixture in the vast American conversation between sports fans and their favorite athletes, teams and leagues. Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American.\\nEvery Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor’s chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios.\\nShe will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.’s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states.\\nBy next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.\\n“Now fans are able to play the game within the game,” Kerney said. “It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who’s going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”\\nLast May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.\\nOn the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.\\nOn the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.\\n“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”\\nAs sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.\\nFigures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.\\nLegalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.\\nIn two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.\\nThe Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.\\nLast year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.\\nAt the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.\\n“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”\\nThe Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.\\nMillman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.\\n“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”\\nFor now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.\\n“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”\\nKerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.\\nWith a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years.\\n“The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don’t have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,” Kerney said. “We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.”\\nYou can follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nRemembering Mel Stottlemyre, Don Newcombe, King Kong Bundy and many others who died this year.\\nMarilynn Smith, 89\\nAn LPGA Founder and Champion\\nHarry Howell, 86\\nRangers Defenseman\\nJulia Ruth Stevens, 102\\nBabe Ruth’s Daughter\\nEusebio Pedroza, \\nFeatherweight Boxer\\nKing Kong Bundy, 63\\nProfessional Wrestler\\nTed Lindsay, 93\\nDetroit Red Wings Star\\nDon Newcombe, 92\\nBarrier‑Breaking Dodgers Pitcher\\nGene Littler, 88\\nGolfer With a Gorgeous Swing\\nFrank Robinson, 83\\nBaseball\\'s First Black Manager\\nBob Friend, 88\\nYankee‑Defeating Pirate Pitcher\\nFred Thompson, 85\\nChampion of Women in Track and Field\\nJohn Coughlin, 33\\nSkating Champion\\nMel Stottlemyre, 77\\nYankees\\' Ace\\nProduced by Daniel E.

Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.\\n“Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”\\n— Billie Jean King, a tennis legend who led the charge for pay equality in her sport\\nLast week, all 28 players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team — the greatest women’s soccer team in the world — filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, another move in its long-running battle for equality.\\nThe athletes — including the stars Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd — are not just taking issue with their paychecks but also with where they play, how they travel to matches, and the medical treatment and coaching they receive, in what they called “institutionalized gender discrimination,” as my colleague Andy Das reported.\\n“We’ve always, dating back to forever, been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place,” Rapinoe told The New York Times on Friday.\\nThe women’s team holds a record three World Cup championships and four Olympic gold medals.\\n[READ MORE: U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination]\\nThe issue of pay inequality in sports is of course not just soccer’s problem. Women across all sports are paid less, and many have fought for equity in salary and in prize money. \\nHere are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.\\nThe U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.\\n[READ MORE: Eight Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality]\\nThe Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men’s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women’s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women\\'s Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\\nThe W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000. The minimum starting salary for N.B.A. players is about $580,000.\\nLast summer, A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the No. 1 overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, commented on LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “Must be nice. We over here looking for an M but Lord, let me get back in my lane,” she tweeted. Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, is expected to earn $6.8 million in his first year.\\nU.S.A. Hockey. In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey did not increase the women’s wages. The risk paid off. Within days, the team and U.S.A. Hockey reached a four-year deal that gave the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time.\\nSign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox!\\n______\\nHere are five articles from The Times you might have missed.\\n“My passion has been taken away.” A midwife who has delivered hundreds of babies for Mennonite women is facing felony charges for practicing without the proper license.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”\\nWhen Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”\\nMs. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. \\nBefore finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).\\nIn a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).\\nThe good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)\\nMs. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”\\nWhen possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.\\nAlthough many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.\\nAfter measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.\\nSports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.\\nEncapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.\\nCombination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.\\nSome more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.\\nHook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.\\nMost of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.\\nMove on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.\\nIf you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).\\nLook for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.\\nSign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday. \\nA version of this article appears at Wirecutter.com.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Reuters\\n(Reuters) - Billionaire Mike Ashley\\'s Sports Direct said it did not intend to make an offer to buy Debenhams after lenders took control of the ailing retailer on Tuesday.\\nSports Direct had until April 22 to make a firm offer for the retailer or walk away under British takeover rules.\\nDebenhams was locked in a long-running battle for control with its largest shareholder, Ashley\\'s Sports Direct.\\n (Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy\\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.\\nA year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.\\nThe result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.\\nBut critics saw few systemic changes.\\n“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.\\nA history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.\\n“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”\\nAnd that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.\\nStudents in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.\\nSmith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)\\nMore righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.\\nHis class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.\\n“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.\\nSmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.\\nWhile Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.\\n“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”\\nSmith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.\\nWithin three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.\\nThat summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.\\nSmith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)\\n“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.\\nSmith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.\\nSouthall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.\\n“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.\\nTo hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”\\n“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”\\nAlly Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”\\nHer days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.\\n“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”\\nStill, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy The Associated Press\\nTiger Woods\\' win at the Masters is still a hot topic.\\n PodcastOne Sports Now hosts Jim Litke and Tim Dahlberg look back at the memorable moment that transcended the sports world.

One reason? Examples like Tunica, Miss.\\nBy Timothy Williams\\nTUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. \\nWhen Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. \\nBut in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.\\nThen last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. \\nThe vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. \\nThe reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.\\n“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.\\nSince the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.\\nIn all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.\\nWest Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.\\nRhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.\\nNew Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. \\nThe nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.\\nTribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.\\nA year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.\\nThe area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. \\nAlong Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.\\nBefore casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.\\nBut legalized gambling brought change. \\nCotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.\\nEarly on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.\\nAt the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.\\nBut within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. \\nAs the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.\\nThe effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.\\nSome residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.\\nMr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.\\n“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” \\nSports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.\\nBut in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.\\nSo far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.\\nIn all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.\\n“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.\\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. \\nPete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.\\n“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. \\n \\nR. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.\\n“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”\\nMany gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.\\n“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said. He sighed, and for a moment, his optimism dissolved. “That’s a real challenge.”\\nAn earlier version of this story misstated which year the Tunica area\\'s largest casino, Harrah\\'s Tunica, closed.

These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.\\nThe Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.\\nUnlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.\\nThat is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.\\n[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.]\\nIn short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”\\nThe water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.\\nThe practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.\\nStanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.\\nFederal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.\\nAt the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.\\nAccording to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.\\nKathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”\\nEven fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”\\nMeghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.\\nAt U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.\\nThe coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.\\nHe told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”\\nA month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.\\nAccording to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.\\nStanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.\\n“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”\\nNo school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.\\nSinger is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.\\nThe central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July. She was fired Tuesday.\\nThe school’s water polo coach, Vavic, is accused of accepting $250,000 from Singer after two students were admitted as water polo players. Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.\\nAli Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.\\nWake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.\\nIn a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. It is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”\\nThe case is only the latest to rock U.S.C. The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.\\nProsecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.\\n“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.\\n“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.\\nLater, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”\\n“But she’s not,” Huneeus said.\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the profession of William Singer. He worked in the college counseling business; he is not an intellectual property lawyer.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Joe Drape\\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lisa Kerney once earned her living hosting “SportsCenter” on ESPN, making her a nightly fixture in the vast American conversation between sports fans and their favorite athletes, teams and leagues. Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American.\\nEvery Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor’s chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios.\\nShe will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.’s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states.\\nBy next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.\\n“Now fans are able to play the game within the game,” Kerney said. “It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who’s going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”\\nLast May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.\\nOn the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.\\nOn the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.\\n“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”\\nAs sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.\\nFigures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.\\nLegalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.\\nIn two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.\\nThe Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.\\nLast year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.\\nAt the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.\\n“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”\\nThe Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.\\nMillman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.\\n“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”\\nFor now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.\\n“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”\\nKerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.\\nWith a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik.

Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.\\n“Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”\\n— Billie Jean King, a tennis legend who led the charge for pay equality in her sport\\nLast week, all 28 players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team — the greatest women’s soccer team in the world — filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, another move in its long-running battle for equality.\\nThe athletes — including the stars Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd — are not just taking issue with their paychecks but also with where they play, how they travel to matches, and the medical treatment and coaching they receive, in what they called “institutionalized gender discrimination,” as my colleague Andy Das reported.\\n“We’ve always, dating back to forever, been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place,” Rapinoe told The New York Times on Friday.\\nThe women’s team holds a record three World Cup championships and four Olympic gold medals.\\n[READ MORE: U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination]\\nThe issue of pay inequality in sports is of course not just soccer’s problem. Women across all sports are paid less, and many have fought for equity in salary and in prize money. \\nHere are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.\\nThe U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.\\n[READ MORE: Eight Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality]\\nThe Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men’s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women’s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women\\'s Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\\nThe W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000. The minimum starting salary for N.B.A. players is about $580,000.\\nLast summer, A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the No. 1 overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, commented on LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “Must be nice. We over here looking for an M but Lord, let me get back in my lane,” she tweeted. Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, is expected to earn $6.8 million in his first year.\\nU.S.A. Hockey. In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey did not increase the women’s wages. The risk paid off. Within days, the team and U.S.A. Hockey reached a four-year deal that gave the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time.\\nSign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox!\\n______\\nHere are five articles from The Times you might have missed.\\n“My passion has been taken away.” A midwife who has delivered hundreds of babies for Mennonite women is facing felony charges for practicing without the proper license.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”\\nWhen Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”\\nMs. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. \\nBefore finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).\\nIn a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).\\nThe good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)\\nMs. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”\\nWhen possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.\\nAlthough many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.\\nAfter measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.\\nSports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.\\nEncapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.\\nCombination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.\\nSome more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.\\nHook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.\\nMost of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.\\nMove on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.\\nIf you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).\\nLook for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.\\nSign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday. \\nA version of this article appears at Wirecutter.com.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Reuters\\n(Reuters) - Billionaire Mike Ashley\\'s Sports Direct said it did not intend to make an offer to buy Debenhams after lenders took control of the ailing retailer on Tuesday.\\nSports Direct had until April 22 to make a firm offer for the retailer or walk away under British takeover rules.\\nDebenhams was locked in a long-running battle for control with its largest shareholder, Ashley\\'s Sports Direct.\\n (Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy\\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.\\nA year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.\\nThe result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.\\nBut critics saw few systemic changes.\\n“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.\\nA history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.\\n“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”\\nAnd that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.\\nStudents in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.\\nSmith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)\\nMore righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.\\nHis class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.\\n“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.\\nSmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.\\nWhile Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.\\n“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”\\nSmith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.\\nWithin three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.\\nThat summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.\\nSmith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)\\n“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.\\nSmith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.\\nSouthall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.\\n“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.\\nTo hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”\\n“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”\\nAlly Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”\\nHer days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.\\n“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”\\nStill, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy The Associated Press\\nTiger Woods\\' win at the Masters is still a hot topic.\\n PodcastOne Sports Now hosts Jim Litke and Tim Dahlberg look back at the memorable moment that transcended the sports world.

One reason? Examples like Tunica, Miss.\\nBy Timothy Williams\\nTUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. \\nWhen Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. \\nBut in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.\\nThen last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. \\nThe vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. \\nThe reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.\\n“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.\\nSince the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.\\nIn all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.\\nWest Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.\\nRhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.\\nNew Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. \\nThe nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.\\nTribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.\\nA year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.\\nThe area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. \\nAlong Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.\\nBefore casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.\\nBut legalized gambling brought change. \\nCotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.\\nEarly on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.\\nAt the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.\\nBut within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. \\nAs the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.\\nThe effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.\\nSome residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.\\nMr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.\\n“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” \\nSports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.\\nBut in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.\\nSo far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.\\nIn all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.\\n“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.\\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. \\nPete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.\\n“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. \\n \\nR. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.\\n“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”\\nMany gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.\\n“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said.

That for too long the federations have not done right by them to protect them and empower them,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s an exciting moment to see that happening.\" \\nClosing the pay gap between male and female athletes is critical to attracting women to professional sports, which will in turn boost the popularity of women\\'s sports leagues, he said.\\nWomen would no longer accept being treated as second class citizens by their sports, he said, and will demand a greater share of the overall wealth it generates going forward.\\n\"The WNBA survives and it has been great to see it survive but women who play in the WNBA have to cobble together jobs in Europe in between,\" he said. \\n\"We have to step up as a society and say this matters and that men and women should be on as equal a footing as we can be.\" \\nThe next generation of woman athletes will be better served if they can see similarities between themselves, their coaches and the sports icons they look up to, U.S. gold medalist gymnast Laurie Hernandez said at the Women Coach LA launch event. \\n\"I took it as a really big responsibility to be a role model for these kids,\" she told a gathering of about 400 women at the kickoff for the initiative, which is a partnership between the City of LA and Nike.\\n\"Growing up I didn\\'t see many, if any, Hispanic gymnasts and I just resorted to being my own person,\" she said.\\n\"I guess I didn\\'t realize how big of a deal it was to be a Hispanic American on the Olympic team because then so many little girls started becoming gymnasts,\" she said. \\n\"And it\\'s because they saw someone that looked like them.\" \\n (Reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Nick Mulvenney)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy and Billy Witz\\nThey are sports that bring in little in the way of money or notoriety or attention compared with the behemoths, football and basketball.\\nIn college athletics, volleyball, water polo, sailing, tennis and soccer are relatively small-time affairs that don’t fill stadiums or drive billion-dollar media contracts, and that is why they are at the center of what was described as the broadest college admissions fraud the Justice Department has uncovered.\\nJust like the high-profile sports like football and basketball, coaches in the so-called Olympic sports are generally allowed to reserve several slots each year for students who might not otherwise gain admission. These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.\\nThe Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.\\nUnlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.\\nThat is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.\\n[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.]\\nIn short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”\\nThe water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.\\nThe practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.\\nStanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.\\nFederal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.\\nAt the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.\\nAccording to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.\\nKathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”\\nEven fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”\\nMeghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.\\nAt U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.\\nThe coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.\\nHe told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”\\nA month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.\\nAccording to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.\\nStanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.\\n“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”\\nNo school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.\\nSinger is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.\\nThe central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July. She was fired Tuesday.\\nThe school’s water polo coach, Vavic, is accused of accepting $250,000 from Singer after two students were admitted as water polo players. Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.\\nAli Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.\\nWake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.\\nIn a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. It is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”\\nThe case is only the latest to rock U.S.C. The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.\\nProsecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.\\n“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.\\n“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.\\nLater, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”\\n“But she’s not,” Huneeus said.\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the profession of William Singer. He worked in the college counseling business; he is not an intellectual property lawyer.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Joe Drape\\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lisa Kerney once earned her living hosting “SportsCenter” on ESPN, making her a nightly fixture in the vast American conversation between sports fans and their favorite athletes, teams and leagues. Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American.\\nEvery Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor’s chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios.\\nShe will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.’s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states.\\nBy next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.\\n“Now fans are able to play the game within the game,” Kerney said. “It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who’s going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”\\nLast May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.\\nOn the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.\\nOn the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.\\n“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”\\nAs sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.\\nFigures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.\\nLegalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.\\nIn two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.\\nThe Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.\\nLast year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.\\nAt the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.\\n“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”\\nThe Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.\\nMillman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.\\n“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”\\nFor now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.\\n“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”\\nKerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.\\nWith a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years.\\n“The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don’t have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,” Kerney said. “We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.”\\nYou can follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nRemembering Mel Stottlemyre, Don Newcombe, King Kong Bundy and many others who died this year.\\nMarilynn Smith, 89\\nAn LPGA Founder and Champion\\nHarry Howell, 86\\nRangers Defenseman\\nJulia Ruth Stevens, 102\\nBabe Ruth’s Daughter\\nEusebio Pedroza, \\nFeatherweight Boxer\\nKing Kong Bundy, 63\\nProfessional Wrestler\\nTed Lindsay, 93\\nDetroit Red Wings Star\\nDon Newcombe, 92\\nBarrier‑Breaking Dodgers Pitcher\\nGene Littler, 88\\nGolfer With a Gorgeous Swing\\nFrank Robinson, 83\\nBaseball\\'s First Black Manager\\nBob Friend, 88\\nYankee‑Defeating Pirate Pitcher\\nFred Thompson, 85\\nChampion of Women in Track and Field\\nJohn Coughlin, 33\\nSkating Champion\\nMel Stottlemyre, 77\\nYankees\\' Ace\\nProduced by Daniel E.

Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.\\n“Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”\\n— Billie Jean King, a tennis legend who led the charge for pay equality in her sport\\nLast week, all 28 players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team — the greatest women’s soccer team in the world — filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, another move in its long-running battle for equality.\\nThe athletes — including the stars Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd — are not just taking issue with their paychecks but also with where they play, how they travel to matches, and the medical treatment and coaching they receive, in what they called “institutionalized gender discrimination,” as my colleague Andy Das reported.\\n“We’ve always, dating back to forever, been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place,” Rapinoe told The New York Times on Friday.\\nThe women’s team holds a record three World Cup championships and four Olympic gold medals.\\n[READ MORE: U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination]\\nThe issue of pay inequality in sports is of course not just soccer’s problem. Women across all sports are paid less, and many have fought for equity in salary and in prize money. \\nHere are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.\\nThe U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.\\n[READ MORE: Eight Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality]\\nThe Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men’s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women’s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women\\'s Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\\nThe W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000. The minimum starting salary for N.B.A. players is about $580,000.\\nLast summer, A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the No. 1 overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, commented on LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “Must be nice. We over here looking for an M but Lord, let me get back in my lane,” she tweeted. Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, is expected to earn $6.8 million in his first year.\\nU.S.A. Hockey. In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey did not increase the women’s wages. The risk paid off. Within days, the team and U.S.A. Hockey reached a four-year deal that gave the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time.\\nSign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox!\\n______\\nHere are five articles from The Times you might have missed.\\n“My passion has been taken away.” A midwife who has delivered hundreds of babies for Mennonite women is facing felony charges for practicing without the proper license.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”\\nWhen Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”\\nMs. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. \\nBefore finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).\\nIn a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).\\nThe good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)\\nMs. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”\\nWhen possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.\\nAlthough many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.\\nAfter measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.\\nSports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.\\nEncapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.\\nCombination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.\\nSome more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.\\nHook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.\\nMost of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes.

Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.\\nA year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.\\nThe result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.\\nBut critics saw few systemic changes.\\n“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.\\nA history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.\\n“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”\\nAnd that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.\\nStudents in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.\\nSmith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)\\nMore righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.\\nHis class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.\\n“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.\\nSmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.\\nWhile Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.\\n“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”\\nSmith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.\\nWithin three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.\\nThat summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.\\nSmith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)\\n“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.\\nSmith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.\\nSouthall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.\\n“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.\\nTo hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”\\n“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”\\nAlly Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”\\nHer days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.\\n“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”\\nStill, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy The Associated Press\\nTiger Woods\\' win at the Masters is still a hot topic.\\n PodcastOne Sports Now hosts Jim Litke and Tim Dahlberg look back at the memorable moment that transcended the sports world.

One reason? Examples like Tunica, Miss.\\nBy Timothy Williams\\nTUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. \\nWhen Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. \\nBut in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.\\nThen last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. \\nThe vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. \\nThe reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.\\n“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.\\nSince the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.\\nIn all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.\\nWest Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.\\nRhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.\\nNew Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. \\nThe nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.\\nTribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.\\nA year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.\\nThe area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. \\nAlong Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.\\nBefore casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.\\nBut legalized gambling brought change. \\nCotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.\\nEarly on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.\\nAt the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.\\nBut within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. \\nAs the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.\\nThe effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.\\nSome residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.\\nMr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.\\n“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” \\nSports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.\\nBut in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.\\nSo far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.\\nIn all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.\\n“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.\\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. \\nPete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.\\n“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. \\n \\nR. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.\\n“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”\\nMany gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.\\n“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said. He sighed, and for a moment, his optimism dissolved. “That’s a real challenge.”\\nAn earlier version of this story misstated which year the Tunica area\\'s largest casino, Harrah\\'s Tunica, closed.

These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.\\nThe Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.\\nUnlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.\\nThat is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.\\n[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.]\\nIn short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”\\nThe water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.\\nThe practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.\\nStanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.\\nFederal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.\\nAt the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.\\nAccording to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.\\nKathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”\\nEven fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”\\nMeghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.\\nAt U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.\\nThe coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.\\nHe told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”\\nA month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.\\nAccording to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.\\nStanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.\\n“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”\\nNo school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.\\nSinger is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.\\nThe central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July. She was fired Tuesday.\\nThe school’s water polo coach, Vavic, is accused of accepting $250,000 from Singer after two students were admitted as water polo players. Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.\\nAli Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.\\nWake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.\\nIn a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. It is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”\\nThe case is only the latest to rock U.S.C. The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.\\nProsecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.\\n“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.\\n“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.\\nLater, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”\\n“But she’s not,” Huneeus said.\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the profession of William Singer. He worked in the college counseling business; he is not an intellectual property lawyer.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Joe Drape\\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lisa Kerney once earned her living hosting “SportsCenter” on ESPN, making her a nightly fixture in the vast American conversation between sports fans and their favorite athletes, teams and leagues. Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American.\\nEvery Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor’s chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios.\\nShe will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.’s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states.\\nBy next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.\\n“Now fans are able to play the game within the game,” Kerney said. “It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who’s going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”\\nLast May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.\\nOn the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.\\nOn the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.\\n“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”\\nAs sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.\\nFigures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.\\nLegalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.\\nIn two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.\\nThe Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.\\nLast year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.\\nAt the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.\\n“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”\\nThe Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.\\nMillman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.\\n“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”\\nFor now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.\\n“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”\\nKerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.\\nWith a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years.\\n“The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don’t have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,” Kerney said. “We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.”\\nYou can follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nRemembering Mel Stottlemyre, Don Newcombe, King Kong Bundy and many others who died this year.\\nMarilynn Smith, 89\\nAn LPGA Founder and Champion\\nHarry Howell, 86\\nRangers Defenseman\\nJulia Ruth Stevens, 102\\nBabe Ruth’s Daughter\\nEusebio Pedroza, \\nFeatherweight Boxer\\nKing Kong Bundy, 63\\nProfessional Wrestler\\nTed Lindsay, 93\\nDetroit Red Wings Star\\nDon Newcombe, 92\\nBarrier‑Breaking Dodgers Pitcher\\nGene Littler, 88\\nGolfer With a Gorgeous Swing\\nFrank Robinson, 83\\nBaseball\\'s First Black Manager\\nBob Friend, 88\\nYankee‑Defeating Pirate Pitcher\\nFred Thompson, 85\\nChampion of Women in Track and Field\\nJohn Coughlin, 33\\nSkating Champion\\nMel Stottlemyre, 77\\nYankees\\' Ace\\nProduced by Daniel E.

Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.\\n“Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”\\n— Billie Jean King, a tennis legend who led the charge for pay equality in her sport\\nLast week, all 28 players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team — the greatest women’s soccer team in the world — filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, another move in its long-running battle for equality.\\nThe athletes — including the stars Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd — are not just taking issue with their paychecks but also with where they play, how they travel to matches, and the medical treatment and coaching they receive, in what they called “institutionalized gender discrimination,” as my colleague Andy Das reported.\\n“We’ve always, dating back to forever, been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place,” Rapinoe told The New York Times on Friday.\\nThe women’s team holds a record three World Cup championships and four Olympic gold medals.\\n[READ MORE: U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination]\\nThe issue of pay inequality in sports is of course not just soccer’s problem. Women across all sports are paid less, and many have fought for equity in salary and in prize money. \\nHere are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.\\nThe U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.\\n[READ MORE: Eight Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality]\\nThe Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men’s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women’s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women\\'s Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\\nThe W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000. The minimum starting salary for N.B.A. players is about $580,000.\\nLast summer, A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the No. 1 overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, commented on LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “Must be nice. We over here looking for an M but Lord, let me get back in my lane,” she tweeted. Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, is expected to earn $6.8 million in his first year.\\nU.S.A. Hockey. In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey did not increase the women’s wages. The risk paid off. Within days, the team and U.S.A. Hockey reached a four-year deal that gave the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time.\\nSign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox!\\n______\\nHere are five articles from The Times you might have missed.\\n“My passion has been taken away.” A midwife who has delivered hundreds of babies for Mennonite women is facing felony charges for practicing without the proper license.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”\\nWhen Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”\\nMs. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. \\nBefore finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).\\nIn a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).\\nThe good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)\\nMs. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”\\nWhen possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.\\nAlthough many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.\\nAfter measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.\\nSports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.\\nEncapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.\\nCombination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.\\nSome more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.\\nHook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.\\nMost of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.\\nMove on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.\\nIf you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).\\nLook for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.\\nSign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday. \\nA version of this article appears at Wirecutter.com.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Reuters\\n(Reuters) - Billionaire Mike Ashley\\'s Sports Direct said it did not intend to make an offer to buy Debenhams after lenders took control of the ailing retailer on Tuesday.\\nSports Direct had until April 22 to make a firm offer for the retailer or walk away under British takeover rules.\\nDebenhams was locked in a long-running battle for control with its largest shareholder, Ashley\\'s Sports Direct.\\n (Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy\\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.\\nA year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.\\nThe result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.\\nBut critics saw few systemic changes.\\n“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.\\nA history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.\\n“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”\\nAnd that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.\\nStudents in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.\\nSmith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)\\nMore righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.\\nHis class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.\\n“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.\\nSmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.\\nWhile Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.\\n“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”\\nSmith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.\\nWithin three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.\\nThat summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.\\nSmith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)\\n“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.\\nSmith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.\\nSouthall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.\\n“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.\\nTo hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”\\n“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”\\nAlly Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”\\nHer days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.\\n“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”\\nStill, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy The Associated Press\\nTiger Woods\\' win at the Masters is still a hot topic.\\n PodcastOne Sports Now hosts Jim Litke and Tim Dahlberg look back at the memorable moment that transcended the sports world.

One reason? Examples like Tunica, Miss.\\nBy Timothy Williams\\nTUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. \\nWhen Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. \\nBut in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.\\nThen last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. \\nThe vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. \\nThe reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.\\n“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.\\nSince the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.\\nIn all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.\\nWest Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.\\nRhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.\\nNew Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. \\nThe nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.\\nTribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.\\nA year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.\\nThe area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. \\nAlong Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.\\nBefore casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.\\nBut legalized gambling brought change. \\nCotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.\\nEarly on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.\\nAt the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.\\nBut within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. \\nAs the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.\\nThe effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.\\nSome residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.\\nMr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.\\n“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” \\nSports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.\\nBut in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.\\nSo far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.\\nIn all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.\\n“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.\\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. \\nPete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.\\n“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. \\n \\nR. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.\\n“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”\\nMany gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.\\n“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said. He sighed, and for a moment, his optimism dissolved. “That’s a real challenge.”\\nAn earlier version of this story misstated which year the Tunica area\\'s largest casino, Harrah\\'s Tunica, closed.

That for too long the federations have not done right by them to protect them and empower them,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s an exciting moment to see that happening.\" \\nClosing the pay gap between male and female athletes is critical to attracting women to professional sports, which will in turn boost the popularity of women\\'s sports leagues, he said.\\nWomen would no longer accept being treated as second class citizens by their sports, he said, and will demand a greater share of the overall wealth it generates going forward.\\n\"The WNBA survives and it has been great to see it survive but women who play in the WNBA have to cobble together jobs in Europe in between,\" he said. \\n\"We have to step up as a society and say this matters and that men and women should be on as equal a footing as we can be.\" \\nThe next generation of woman athletes will be better served if they can see similarities between themselves, their coaches and the sports icons they look up to, U.S. gold medalist gymnast Laurie Hernandez said at the Women Coach LA launch event. \\n\"I took it as a really big responsibility to be a role model for these kids,\" she told a gathering of about 400 women at the kickoff for the initiative, which is a partnership between the City of LA and Nike.\\n\"Growing up I didn\\'t see many, if any, Hispanic gymnasts and I just resorted to being my own person,\" she said.\\n\"I guess I didn\\'t realize how big of a deal it was to be a Hispanic American on the Olympic team because then so many little girls started becoming gymnasts,\" she said. \\n\"And it\\'s because they saw someone that looked like them.\" \\n (Reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Nick Mulvenney)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy and Billy Witz\\nThey are sports that bring in little in the way of money or notoriety or attention compared with the behemoths, football and basketball.\\nIn college athletics, volleyball, water polo, sailing, tennis and soccer are relatively small-time affairs that don’t fill stadiums or drive billion-dollar media contracts, and that is why they are at the center of what was described as the broadest college admissions fraud the Justice Department has uncovered.\\nJust like the high-profile sports like football and basketball, coaches in the so-called Olympic sports are generally allowed to reserve several slots each year for students who might not otherwise gain admission. These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.\\nThe Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.\\nUnlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.\\nThat is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.\\n[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.]\\nIn short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”\\nThe water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.\\nThe practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.\\nStanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.\\nFederal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.\\nAt the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.\\nAccording to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.\\nKathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”\\nEven fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”\\nMeghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.\\nAt U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.\\nThe coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.\\nHe told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”\\nA month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.\\nAccording to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.\\nStanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.\\n“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”\\nNo school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.\\nSinger is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.\\nThe central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July. She was fired Tuesday.\\nThe school’s water polo coach, Vavic, is accused of accepting $250,000 from Singer after two students were admitted as water polo players. Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.\\nAli Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.\\nWake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.\\nIn a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. It is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”\\nThe case is only the latest to rock U.S.C. The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.\\nProsecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.\\n“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.\\n“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.\\nLater, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”\\n“But she’s not,” Huneeus said.\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the profession of William Singer. He worked in the college counseling business; he is not an intellectual property lawyer.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Joe Drape\\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lisa Kerney once earned her living hosting “SportsCenter” on ESPN, making her a nightly fixture in the vast American conversation between sports fans and their favorite athletes, teams and leagues. Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American.\\nEvery Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor’s chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios.\\nShe will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.’s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states.\\nBy next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.\\n“Now fans are able to play the game within the game,” Kerney said. “It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who’s going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”\\nLast May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.\\nOn the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.\\nOn the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.\\n“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”\\nAs sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.\\nFigures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.\\nLegalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.\\nIn two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.\\nThe Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.\\nLast year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.\\nAt the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.\\n“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”\\nThe Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.\\nMillman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.\\n“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”\\nFor now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.\\n“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”\\nKerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.\\nWith a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years.\\n“The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don’t have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,” Kerney said. “We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.”\\nYou can follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nRemembering Mel Stottlemyre, Don Newcombe, King Kong Bundy and many others who died this year.\\nMarilynn Smith, 89\\nAn LPGA Founder and Champion\\nHarry Howell, 86\\nRangers Defenseman\\nJulia Ruth Stevens, 102\\nBabe Ruth’s Daughter\\nEusebio Pedroza, \\nFeatherweight Boxer\\nKing Kong Bundy, 63\\nProfessional Wrestler\\nTed Lindsay, 93\\nDetroit Red Wings Star\\nDon Newcombe, 92\\nBarrier‑Breaking Dodgers Pitcher\\nGene Littler, 88\\nGolfer With a Gorgeous Swing\\nFrank Robinson, 83\\nBaseball\\'s First Black Manager\\nBob Friend, 88\\nYankee‑Defeating Pirate Pitcher\\nFred Thompson, 85\\nChampion of Women in Track and Field\\nJohn Coughlin, 33\\nSkating Champion\\nMel Stottlemyre, 77\\nYankees\\' Ace\\nProduced by Daniel E.

Women across all sports are paid less, and many have fought for equity in salary and in prize money. \\nHere are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.\\nThe U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.\\n[READ MORE: Eight Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality]\\nThe Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men’s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women’s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women\\'s Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\\nThe W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000. The minimum starting salary for N.B.A. players is about $580,000.\\nLast summer, A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the No. 1 overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, commented on LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “Must be nice. We over here looking for an M but Lord, let me get back in my lane,” she tweeted. Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, is expected to earn $6.8 million in his first year.\\nU.S.A. Hockey. In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey did not increase the women’s wages. The risk paid off. Within days, the team and U.S.A. Hockey reached a four-year deal that gave the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time.\\nSign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox!\\n______\\nHere are five articles from The Times you might have missed.\\n“My passion has been taken away.” A midwife who has delivered hundreds of babies for Mennonite women is facing felony charges for practicing without the proper license.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”\\nWhen Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”\\nMs. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. \\nBefore finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).\\nIn a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).\\nThe good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)\\nMs. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”\\nWhen possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.\\nAlthough many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.\\nAfter measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.\\nSports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.\\nEncapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.\\nCombination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.\\nSome more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.\\nHook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.\\nMost of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.\\nMove on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.\\nIf you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).\\nLook for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.\\nSign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday. \\nA version of this article appears at Wirecutter.com.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Reuters\\n(Reuters) - Billionaire Mike Ashley\\'s Sports Direct said it did not intend to make an offer to buy Debenhams after lenders took control of the ailing retailer on Tuesday.\\nSports Direct had until April 22 to make a firm offer for the retailer or walk away under British takeover rules.\\nDebenhams was locked in a long-running battle for control with its largest shareholder, Ashley\\'s Sports Direct.\\n (Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy\\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.\\nA year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.\\nThe result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.\\nBut critics saw few systemic changes.\\n“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.\\nA history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.\\n“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”\\nAnd that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.\\nStudents in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.\\nSmith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)\\nMore righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.\\nHis class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.\\n“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.\\nSmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.\\nWhile Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.\\n“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”\\nSmith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.\\nWithin three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.\\nThat summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.\\nSmith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)\\n“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.\\nSmith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.\\nSouthall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.\\n“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.\\nTo hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”\\n“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”\\nAlly Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”\\nHer days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.\\n“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”\\nStill, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy The Associated Press\\nTiger Woods\\' win at the Masters is still a hot topic.\\n PodcastOne Sports Now hosts Jim Litke and Tim Dahlberg look back at the memorable moment that transcended the sports world.

One reason? Examples like Tunica, Miss.\\nBy Timothy Williams\\nTUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. \\nWhen Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. \\nBut in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.\\nThen last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. \\nThe vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. \\nThe reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.\\n“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.\\nSince the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.\\nIn all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.\\nWest Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.\\nRhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.\\nNew Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. \\nThe nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.\\nTribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.\\nA year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.\\nThe area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. \\nAlong Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.\\nBefore casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.\\nBut legalized gambling brought change. \\nCotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.\\nEarly on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.\\nAt the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.\\nBut within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. \\nAs the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.\\nThe effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.\\nSome residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.\\nMr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.\\n“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” \\nSports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.\\nBut in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.\\nSo far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.\\nIn all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.\\n“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.\\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. \\nPete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.\\n“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. \\n \\nR. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.\\n“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”\\nMany gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.\\n“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said. He sighed, and for a moment, his optimism dissolved. “That’s a real challenge.”\\nAn earlier version of this story misstated which year the Tunica area\\'s largest casino, Harrah\\'s Tunica, closed.

These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.\\nThe Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.\\nUnlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.\\nThat is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.\\n[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.]\\nIn short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”\\nThe water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.\\nThe practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.\\nStanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.\\nFederal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.\\nAt the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.\\nAccording to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.\\nKathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”\\nEven fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”\\nMeghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.\\nAt U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.\\nThe coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.\\nHe told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”\\nA month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.\\nAccording to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.\\nStanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.\\n“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”\\nNo school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.\\nSinger is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.\\nThe central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July. She was fired Tuesday.\\nThe school’s water polo coach, Vavic, is accused of accepting $250,000 from Singer after two students were admitted as water polo players. Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.\\nAli Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.\\nWake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.\\nIn a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. It is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”\\nThe case is only the latest to rock U.S.C. The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.\\nProsecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.\\n“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.\\n“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.\\nLater, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”\\n“But she’s not,” Huneeus said.\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the profession of William Singer.

It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”\\nLast May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.\\nOn the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.\\nOn the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.\\n“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”\\nAs sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.\\nFigures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.\\nLegalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.\\nIn two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.\\nThe Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.\\nLast year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.\\nAt the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.\\n“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”\\nThe Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.\\nMillman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.\\n“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”\\nFor now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.\\n“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”\\nKerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.\\nWith a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years.\\n“The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don’t have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,” Kerney said. “We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.”\\nYou can follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nRemembering Mel Stottlemyre, Don Newcombe, King Kong Bundy and many others who died this year.\\nMarilynn Smith, 89\\nAn LPGA Founder and Champion\\nHarry Howell, 86\\nRangers Defenseman\\nJulia Ruth Stevens, 102\\nBabe Ruth’s Daughter\\nEusebio Pedroza, \\nFeatherweight Boxer\\nKing Kong Bundy, 63\\nProfessional Wrestler\\nTed Lindsay, 93\\nDetroit Red Wings Star\\nDon Newcombe, 92\\nBarrier‑Breaking Dodgers Pitcher\\nGene Littler, 88\\nGolfer With a Gorgeous Swing\\nFrank Robinson, 83\\nBaseball\\'s First Black Manager\\nBob Friend, 88\\nYankee‑Defeating Pirate Pitcher\\nFred Thompson, 85\\nChampion of Women in Track and Field\\nJohn Coughlin, 33\\nSkating Champion\\nMel Stottlemyre, 77\\nYankees\\' Ace\\nProduced by Daniel E.

Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.\\n“Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”\\n— Billie Jean King, a tennis legend who led the charge for pay equality in her sport\\nLast week, all 28 players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team — the greatest women’s soccer team in the world — filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, another move in its long-running battle for equality.\\nThe athletes — including the stars Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd — are not just taking issue with their paychecks but also with where they play, how they travel to matches, and the medical treatment and coaching they receive, in what they called “institutionalized gender discrimination,” as my colleague Andy Das reported.\\n“We’ve always, dating back to forever, been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place,” Rapinoe told The New York Times on Friday.\\nThe women’s team holds a record three World Cup championships and four Olympic gold medals.\\n[READ MORE: U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination]\\nThe issue of pay inequality in sports is of course not just soccer’s problem. Women across all sports are paid less, and many have fought for equity in salary and in prize money. \\nHere are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.\\nThe U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.\\n[READ MORE: Eight Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality]\\nThe Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men’s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women’s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women\\'s Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\\nThe W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000. The minimum starting salary for N.B.A. players is about $580,000.\\nLast summer, A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the No. 1 overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, commented on LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “Must be nice. We over here looking for an M but Lord, let me get back in my lane,” she tweeted. Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, is expected to earn $6.8 million in his first year.\\nU.S.A. Hockey. In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey did not increase the women’s wages. The risk paid off. Within days, the team and U.S.A. Hockey reached a four-year deal that gave the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time.\\nSign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox!\\n______\\nHere are five articles from The Times you might have missed.\\n“My passion has been taken away.” A midwife who has delivered hundreds of babies for Mennonite women is facing felony charges for practicing without the proper license.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”\\nWhen Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”\\nMs. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. \\nBefore finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).\\nIn a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).\\nThe good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)\\nMs. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”\\nWhen possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.\\nAlthough many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.\\nAfter measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.\\nSports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.\\nEncapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.\\nCombination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.\\nSome more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.\\nHook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.\\nMost of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.\\nMove on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.\\nIf you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).\\nLook for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.\\nSign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday. \\nA version of this article appears at Wirecutter.com.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Reuters\\n(Reuters) - Billionaire Mike Ashley\\'s Sports Direct said it did not intend to make an offer to buy Debenhams after lenders took control of the ailing retailer on Tuesday.\\nSports Direct had until April 22 to make a firm offer for the retailer or walk away under British takeover rules.\\nDebenhams was locked in a long-running battle for control with its largest shareholder, Ashley\\'s Sports Direct.\\n (Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy\\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.\\nA year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.\\nThe result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.\\nBut critics saw few systemic changes.\\n“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.\\nA history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.\\n“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”\\nAnd that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.\\nStudents in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.\\nSmith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)\\nMore righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.\\nHis class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.\\n“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.\\nSmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.\\nWhile Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.\\n“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”\\nSmith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.\\nWithin three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.\\nThat summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.\\nSmith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)\\n“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.\\nSmith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.\\nSouthall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.\\n“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.\\nTo hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”\\n“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”\\nAlly Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”\\nHer days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.\\n“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”\\nStill, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy The Associated Press\\nTiger Woods\\' win at the Masters is still a hot topic.\\n PodcastOne Sports Now hosts Jim Litke and Tim Dahlberg look back at the memorable moment that transcended the sports world.

One reason? Examples like Tunica, Miss.\\nBy Timothy Williams\\nTUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. \\nWhen Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. \\nBut in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.\\nThen last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. \\nThe vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. \\nThe reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.\\n“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.\\nSince the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.\\nIn all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.\\nWest Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.\\nRhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.\\nNew Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. \\nThe nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.\\nTribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.\\nA year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.\\nThe area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. \\nAlong Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.\\nBefore casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.\\nBut legalized gambling brought change. \\nCotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.\\nEarly on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.\\nAt the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.\\nBut within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. \\nAs the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.\\nThe effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.\\nSome residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.\\nMr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.\\n“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” \\nSports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.\\nBut in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.\\nSo far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.\\nIn all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.\\n“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.\\nOn a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. \\nPete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.\\n“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. \\n \\nR. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.\\n“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”\\nMany gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.\\n“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said. He sighed, and for a moment, his optimism dissolved. “That’s a real challenge.”\\nAn earlier version of this story misstated which year the Tunica area\\'s largest casino, Harrah\\'s Tunica, closed.

That for too long the federations have not done right by them to protect them and empower them,\" he said.\\n\"It\\'s an exciting moment to see that happening.\" \\nClosing the pay gap between male and female athletes is critical to attracting women to professional sports, which will in turn boost the popularity of women\\'s sports leagues, he said.\\nWomen would no longer accept being treated as second class citizens by their sports, he said, and will demand a greater share of the overall wealth it generates going forward.\\n\"The WNBA survives and it has been great to see it survive but women who play in the WNBA have to cobble together jobs in Europe in between,\" he said. \\n\"We have to step up as a society and say this matters and that men and women should be on as equal a footing as we can be.\" \\nThe next generation of woman athletes will be better served if they can see similarities between themselves, their coaches and the sports icons they look up to, U.S. gold medalist gymnast Laurie Hernandez said at the Women Coach LA launch event. \\n\"I took it as a really big responsibility to be a role model for these kids,\" she told a gathering of about 400 women at the kickoff for the initiative, which is a partnership between the City of LA and Nike.\\n\"Growing up I didn\\'t see many, if any, Hispanic gymnasts and I just resorted to being my own person,\" she said.\\n\"I guess I didn\\'t realize how big of a deal it was to be a Hispanic American on the Olympic team because then so many little girls started becoming gymnasts,\" she said. \\n\"And it\\'s because they saw someone that looked like them.\" \\n (Reporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Nick Mulvenney)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Marc Tracy and Billy Witz\\nThey are sports that bring in little in the way of money or notoriety or attention compared with the behemoths, football and basketball.\\nIn college athletics, volleyball, water polo, sailing, tennis and soccer are relatively small-time affairs that don’t fill stadiums or drive billion-dollar media contracts, and that is why they are at the center of what was described as the broadest college admissions fraud the Justice Department has uncovered.\\nJust like the high-profile sports like football and basketball, coaches in the so-called Olympic sports are generally allowed to reserve several slots each year for students who might not otherwise gain admission. These slots are often in addition to those reserved for the truly elite athletes who receive athletic scholarships or their equivalent at the most selective universities.\\nThe Justice Department investigation revealed how this alternative admission path can be exploited and corrupted, especially at the dozen elite universities that were a target.\\nUnlike in football and basketball, there is little in the way of formal rankings or general knowledge about who might be good at what are seen as minor sports, so admissions officials usually have to take coaches at their word when they tell them that an applicant is worthy of a spot on a volleyball or soccer or sailing team, leaving them open to exploitation.\\nThat is more difficult to do in big sports. “In basketball and football, it’s out there in the open, compared to the less financially driven sports,” said Corey Evans, a basketball recruiting analyst at Rivals, the recruiting website.\\n[Several college coaches were named in the federal indictment Tuesday. Read more about each of them.]\\nIn short order Tuesday, the sailing coach at Stanford was fired. The U.C.L.A. men’s soccer coach was placed on leave, as was the Wake Forest women’s volleyball coach, and the men’s tennis coach at the University of Texas. J.B. Bird, a university spokesman, said Texas was “cooperating fully with the investigation. Integrity in admissions is vital to the academic and ethical standards of our university.” The university stated it believed Coach Michael Center’s actions did not involve “any other university employees or officers.”\\nThe water polo coach at the University of Southern California, Jovan Vavic, who has won 16 national championships, was fired after he was arrested at his hotel room early Tuesday morning in Hawaii, where he had traveled with the top-ranked women’s team for a match.\\nThe practice of reserving spots for athletes in minor sports has grown in recent years, people involved with college sports say, as more colleges have committed to pursuing excellence in every activity, from the chemistry lab to the tennis courts. Also, as the population continues to grow, slots at the most selective colleges are more competitive than ever.\\nStanford University said that last year, 47,450 students applied for admission, and the university accepted just 2,040. The acceptance rate of 4.29 percent was the lowest in Stanford’s history. No wonder, according to the complaint, the prominent Massachusetts real estate developer John B. Wilson paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2018 to secure a spot for his daughter at Stanford.\\nFederal prosecutors did not charge students or universities with wrongdoing.\\nAt the heart of the scheme was William Singer, who, between 2011 and 2018, collected $25 million from parents to bribe coaches, and encouraged them to go to great lengths to falsely present their children as the sort of top-flight athletes that coaches would want to recruit.\\nAccording to the indictment, Singer fabricated athletic “profiles” of the students to submit with their applications, which contained teams the students had not played on and fake honors not won. One student sat on a rowing machine to pass herself off as a rower. Singer’s associates also photoshopped the faces of the applicants onto images of athletes found on the internet.\\nKathy DeBoer, the executive director of the American Volleyball Coaches Association, said “people in the volleyball community know who the elite athletes are, but there isn’t enough of a spectator base at most places.”\\nEven fans of extraordinarily popular volleyball squads, like Nebraska’s, “are following who they’re bringing in,” she said, “but they may not be following their walk-ons. And there isn’t a community that is vested in who are the preferred walk-ons coming on to the volleyball team.”\\nMeghan Dubyak, a spokeswoman for Georgetown University, said the university had fired its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, in December 2017 after an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions. She did not provide details. Ernst became the tennis coach at the University of Rhode Island last year. The university placed him on leave Tuesday.\\nAt U.C.L.A. Jorge Salcedo “will have no involvement with the soccer team while this matter is under review,” said Tod M. Tamberg, a spokesman for the university. “If the facts alleged are true, they represent a grave departure from the ethical standards we set for ourselves and the people who work here,” Mr. Tamberg said in a statement.\\nThe coach of the Yale soccer team was bribed at least $400,000 to recruit one student. Relatives of that applicant paid Mr. Singer $1.2 million. The coach, Rudy Meredith, stepped down in November.\\nHe told the athletics department then that “it is time to explore new possibilities and begin a different chapter in my life.”\\nA month later, he was elected to the Connecticut Soccer Hall of Fame. He led the Bulldogs team to their first-ever N.C.A.A. tournament and first-ever unshared Ivy League title. Meredith did not return a request for comment at a number believed to belong to him.\\nAccording to court filings, he began cooperating with the investigation in April 2018.\\nStanford University fired its head sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who allegedly took financial contributions to the sailing program from an intermediary in exchange for agreeing to recommend two prospective students for admission.\\n“Neither student came to Stanford,” a statement from Stanford said. “However, the alleged behavior runs completely counter to Stanford’s values.”\\nNo school is more deeply entwined in the scheme than U.S.C.\\nSinger is accused of funneling more than $2 million into accounts controlled by administrators, coaches and former coaches at the school for their help in admitting his clients as student athletes, often with fabricated credentials and sometimes whether they played the sport or not.\\nThe central figure at U.S.C. is Donna Heinel, a senior administrator who for nearly a decade has overseen admissions of athletes. The affidavit charges Singer with depositing $1.3 million in U.S.C. accounts controlled by Heinel over a four-year period, and entering into a sham consulting agreement that paid her $20,000 per month beginning last July. She was fired Tuesday.\\nThe school’s water polo coach, Vavic, is accused of accepting $250,000 from Singer after two students were admitted as water polo players. Singer is also charged with making payments to a private school for Vavic’s children in the guise of a scholarship in exchange for a commitment to designate students as recruits in the future.\\nAli Khosroshahin, a former U.S.C. soccer coach, and Laura Janke, a former assistant, were accused of accepting $350,000 from Singer for a youth soccer club they coached in exchange for designating four students as recruits even though none of them played competitive soccer.\\nWake Forest volleyball coach Bill Ferguson, who arrived from U.S.C. in 2016, is charged with accepting $100,000 from Singer in exchange for helping a client’s daughter, who had been wait-listed by the school, gain admittance as a volleyball recruit.\\nIn a letter, U.S.C.’s interim president Wanda Austin said the university would “be implementing significant process and training enhancements to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. It is immensely disappointing that individuals would abuse their position at the university in this way.”\\nThe case is only the latest to rock U.S.C. The school’s football program was hit with severe N.C.A.A. sanctions in 2010 over payments made to Heisman Trophy winning running back Reggie Bush, and the basketball program is currently under investigation for the second time in the last decade. Former assistant coach Tony Bland pleaded guilty in January to accepting bribes to steer U.S.C. players to certain financial advisers.\\nProsecutors included in court filings a transcript of a somewhat bizarre taped exchange between Singer and Augustin Huneeus Jr., a vineyard owner in Northern California who would provide $250,000 to coaches and other sources that support water polo at U.S.C. in exchange for Coach Vavic securing his daughter’s admission.\\n“You understand that [my daughter] is not worthy to be on that team,” Huneeus said of U.S.C.’s powerhouse water polo team.\\n“He knows [s]he’s not coming to play, he knows all that,” Singer responded, referring to Vavic.\\nLater, he reassured Huneeus that the arrangement would work out “because she’s a water polo player.”\\n“But she’s not,” Huneeus said.\\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the profession of William Singer. He worked in the college counseling business; he is not an intellectual property lawyer.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Joe Drape\\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lisa Kerney once earned her living hosting “SportsCenter” on ESPN, making her a nightly fixture in the vast American conversation between sports fans and their favorite athletes, teams and leagues. Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American.\\nEvery Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor’s chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios.\\nShe will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.’s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states.\\nBy next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.\\n“Now fans are able to play the game within the game,” Kerney said. “It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who’s going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”\\nLast May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.\\nOn the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.\\nOn the retail front, the innovations have been more basic: how-to-bet sports camps, cable shows that explain the difference between a proposition and parlay bets, and Nevada-based tout services — which for decades have picked winners for a price — that have suddenly refashioned themselves into media companies.\\n“If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,” said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. “If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting — the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you’re getting the price — then the market absolutely needs you.”\\nAs sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry.\\nFigures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry’s rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern.\\nLegalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.\\nIn two years, the Las Vegas-based Vegas Stats & Information Network (VSiN) has grown from a start-up streaming service with 1.4 million visitors to 12.6 million visitors a month — across video and audio streams like Sirius XM and fuboTV — seeking “actionable information” delivered by a roster of Las Vegas bookmakers and professional gamblers, including the longtime CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger.\\nThe Super Bowl, though, has been an integral part of America’s sporting fabric and a highlight of the betting year since long before the Supreme Court’s ruling last year made it legal in more jurisdictions.\\nLast year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount — as high as $4.6 billion — wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls.\\nAt the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.\\n“This is a generational thing, and what we’ve seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in ‘moneyball’ and the democracy of information through technology,” said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. “It’s meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team.”\\nThe Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show — called “I’ll Take That Bet” — for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster’s new streaming platform.\\nMillman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company’s app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network’s email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000.\\n“In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,” Millman said. “As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.”\\nFor now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former “SportsCenter” anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands.\\n“Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,” said Kevin Grigsby, the show’s executive producer. “So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts.”\\nKerney and Grigsby’s bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney’s show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney’s show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports.\\nWith a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years.\\n“The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don’t have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,” Kerney said. “We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.”\\nYou can follow Joe Drape on Twitter @joedrape\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nRemembering Mel Stottlemyre, Don Newcombe, King Kong Bundy and many others who died this year.\\nMarilynn Smith, 89\\nAn LPGA Founder and Champion\\nHarry Howell, 86\\nRangers Defenseman\\nJulia Ruth Stevens, 102\\nBabe Ruth’s Daughter\\nEusebio Pedroza, \\nFeatherweight Boxer\\nKing Kong Bundy, 63\\nProfessional Wrestler\\nTed Lindsay, 93\\nDetroit Red Wings Star\\nDon Newcombe, 92\\nBarrier‑Breaking Dodgers Pitcher\\nGene Littler, 88\\nGolfer With a Gorgeous Swing\\nFrank Robinson, 83\\nBaseball\\'s First Black Manager\\nBob Friend, 88\\nYankee‑Defeating Pirate Pitcher\\nFred Thompson, 85\\nChampion of Women in Track and Field\\nJohn Coughlin, 33\\nSkating Champion\\nMel Stottlemyre, 77\\nYankees\\' Ace\\nProduced by Daniel E.

Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.\\n“Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”\\n— Billie Jean King, a tennis legend who led the charge for pay equality in her sport\\nLast week, all 28 players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team — the greatest women’s soccer team in the world — filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation, another move in its long-running battle for equality.\\nThe athletes — including the stars Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd — are not just taking issue with their paychecks but also with where they play, how they travel to matches, and the medical treatment and coaching they receive, in what they called “institutionalized gender discrimination,” as my colleague Andy Das reported.\\n“We’ve always, dating back to forever, been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place,” Rapinoe told The New York Times on Friday.\\nThe women’s team holds a record three World Cup championships and four Olympic gold medals.\\n[READ MORE: U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination]\\nThe issue of pay inequality in sports is of course not just soccer’s problem. Women across all sports are paid less, and many have fought for equity in salary and in prize money. \\nHere are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.\\nThe U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.\\n[READ MORE: Eight Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality]\\nThe Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men’s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women’s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women\\'s Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\\nThe W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000. The minimum starting salary for N.B.A. players is about $580,000.\\nLast summer, A’ja Wilson, a star rookie who was the No. 1 overall W.N.B.A. draft pick in 2018, commented on LeBron James’s $154 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. “Must be nice. We over here looking for an M but Lord, let me get back in my lane,” she tweeted. Wilson earned about $53,000 that season. The top N.B.A. draft pick last year, Deandre Ayton, is expected to earn $6.8 million in his first year.\\nU.S.A. Hockey. In March 2017, the women’s national hockey team announced that it would boycott the coming world championship if U.S.A. Hockey did not increase the women’s wages. The risk paid off. Within days, the team and U.S.A. Hockey reached a four-year deal that gave the female players a $2,000 training stipend each month from the United States Olympic Committee and larger bonuses for winning medals. “We want to do the fair thing, and the right thing — not just for hockey but for all women,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said at the time.\\nSign up here to get In Her Words delivered to your inbox!\\n______\\nHere are five articles from The Times you might have missed.\\n“My passion has been taken away.” A midwife who has delivered hundreds of babies for Mennonite women is facing felony charges for practicing without the proper license.

When she reached the peak, she sent a radio message to her son and daughter: “To Tom and Kate, my dear children, I am on the highest point of the world, and I love you dearly.” \\nHer homeland, Britain, rejoiced. But the excitement did not last long. Three months later, Hargreaves, 33, died descending from the summit of K2 in Pakistan.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”\\nWhen Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”\\nMs. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. \\nBefore finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).\\nIn a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).\\nThe good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)\\nMs. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”\\nWhen possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.\\nAlthough many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.\\nAfter measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.\\nSports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.\\nEncapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.\\nCombination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.\\nSome more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.\\nHook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.\\nMost of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.\\nMove on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.\\nIf you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).\\nLook for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.\\nSign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday. \\nA version of this article appears at Wirecutter.com.\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\nSupported by\\nBy Reuters\\n(Reuters) - Billionaire Mike Ashley\\'s Sports Direct said it did not intend to make an offer to buy Debenhams after lenders took control of the ailing retailer on Tuesday.\\nSports Direct had until April 22 to make a firm offer for the retailer or walk away under British takeover rules.\\nDebenhams was locked in a long-running battle for control with its largest shareholder, Ashley\\'s Sports Direct.\\n (Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n'"

Just 310 people showed up that day at Mastercard Centre, the 1,000-seat practice facility of the N.H.L.’s Toronto Maple Leafs. The turnout was typical for the Furies, one of six clubs in the Canadian Women’s Hockey League.', 'Sami Jo Small, the Furies’ first-year general manager, often sees larger crowds at her motivational speaking engagements. A three-time Olympian for Canada, she does more than 50 appearances a year across North America for corporate clients.', 'That’s how Small, 42, makes her living. Running the Furies is largely a volunteer activity, for now.', 'Through eight seasons as a Furies goaltender, Small saw the difficulties of drawing an audience. She took over the front office in hopes of building something bigger, an enterprise that could pay decent wages to its staff members.', '“I wanted people that are willing to put in the time and effort, because they see value in it,” Small said. “Eventually, my hope is that I can pay these people what they’re actually worth. At the moment, we can’t do that. We have to sort of acknowledge that reality right now.”', 'Small and five other players founded the league in 2007, and she will concede that she expected it to be further along.', 'Toronto is perhaps the world’s most hockey-crazed city, but not only do the Furies draw a tiny fraction of the Leafs’ audience (about 19,200 fans a game), their attendance also falls well short of the numbers for the city’s minor league men’s team, the Marlies. After winning the American Hockey League’s Calder Cup last season, the Marlies are averaging more than 5,600 fans. The Furies have had several strong seasons, winning the championship as recently as 2014, yet the attendance remains so low that the league often reports it as a zero.', 'There have been significant advances recently in the Canadian Women’s Hockey League — which has a team in the United States (Worcester, Mass.) and one in China (Shenzhen). Last season, the players started being paid for the first time. Under a league salary cap of 100,000 Canadian dollars, players receive 2,000 to 10,000 Canadian dollars a season.', 'Also, several prominent members of the rival National Women’s Hockey League, which has five teams in the United States, defected to the Canadian league this season.', 'With the Furies, Small has noted another improvement, the kind many athletes would not welcome: tough analysis by the news media.', 'Though drawing attention is a challenge in Canada’s biggest city, where the Leafs are covered obsessively, Small said bloggers had written about women’s hockey regularly — and with an edge.', '“When I played for the national team, I always felt like within the media, women’s hockey was treated with kid gloves,” she said. “It was, ‘Oh, it’s so great that you guys are doing this or accomplishing this.’ The only bad media written about women’s hockey was that women shouldn’t play hockey or women’s hockey shouldn’t be at this level.', '“There was never media coverage that said: ‘Sami Jo wasn’t at the top of her game. She didn’t play her best tonight.’ We now have people at our practices, knowing the players, knowing what level they should be at.”', 'The Canadian Women’s Hockey League does not consistently report attendance figures. But the Montreal team, which draws the largest audiences of the four clubs in Canada, attracted 1,567 fans to its home opener on Oct. 13. Last season, when the league added the expansion franchise in China — Kunlun Red Star — to help develop women’s hockey in the country ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022, the team averaged 2,000 fans. (When the North American teams travel to China, they stay for a series of games.)', 'By professional sports standards, Furies tickets are inexpensive. A 14-game season ticket costs 175 Canadian dollars, and regular-season games are 15 Canadian dollars each. By contrast, the average price for a single upper-bowl ticket at Scotiabank Arena for a Leafs regular-season game is 94 Canadian dollars.', 'The Leafs and the Furies started a partnership in 2012, in which the N.H.L. franchise invests 30,000 Canadian dollars annually in the Furies for equipment, uniforms and travel, and also to offset the costs of coaching. The club also invites the Furies to participate in various Leafs skills development clinics and youth programs, and the partnership expanded in 2015 to include the sale of Furies merchandise at the Leafs’ arena.', 'Small said that the partnership had also provided superior facilities for the Furies and that she had used them to help recruit players. “We have a great, dedicated dressing room,” she said. “We have a gym right there and a medical facility.”', 'Small, who played on a men’s hockey team at Stanford while working toward a degree in mechanical engineering, uses her home in Mississauga, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto, as her primary office, where she also handles administrative duties for her speaking career.', 'The Furies play weekend games and practice in Toronto from 9:15 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays — more frequently than any other C.W.H.L. team. It is the only time they can get the ice. Small tries to accommodate her players’ educational, professional and family responsibilities.', 'Forward Anissa Gamble came to Toronto to pursue a doctorate in diabetes research, and defender Katie Gaskin is a chiropractic student. Defender Shannon Moulson — younger sister of Matt Moulson, a former Islanders forward — is an elementary schoolteacher.', '“Shannon Moulson lives in Hillsburgh, so she has a one- hour, 15-minute commute home after practice, and then has to be at school at 8 o’clock in the morning,” Small said. “Do I think she’s exhausted? Yes. She’s constantly on the road.”', 'To help, Small made Wednesday practice optional. “When I think of Sami Jo, I think of how generous and approachable she is,” said Renata Fast, one of three Furies who played for Canada’s 2018 Olympic silver medalists. “She always makes time for that one-on-one connection.”', 'To raise money and build fan loyalty, Small offers skills clinics for women in recreational hockey leagues, charging them 50 Canadian dollars apiece to skate with the Furies. A recent event netted the club 900 Canadian dollars.', '“I think we have a pretty big impact on them,” Sarah Nurse, another 2018 Olympian, said. “For them to come and tell us their stories about how they started playing hockey at 40, 45 years old and they just love the game, it’s amazing for us.”', 'Small said these recreational players constituted the majority of Furies fans, attending with their family and friends. She focuses her marketing on them, rather than on young girls working toward playing professionally. According to the Ontario Women’s Hockey Association, the province had 38,914 registered female players at all levels of the sport in 2017-18.', '“The reality is that most of the young female players in southern Ontario have tournaments every weekend,” Small said. “Their parents are carting them off from one rink to the next rink. They don’t necessarily have time to come to our games.”', 'Just two C.W.H.L. regular-season games have been televised across the country this season, and Furies games are not broadcast on radio.', '“It would obviously be nice if we had more of our games on TV and even more support from the Leafs and Marlies,” said Natalie Spooner, another of the Furies’ Olympians. “But I do think they try to support us the best they can. Hopefully, eventually we can get to the point where we’re more of a sister team and maybe play back-to-back games or something like that.”', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Supported by', 'After being deported from the United States as a collegian, Hector Majul has bounced around, most recently landing in Lithuania. ', 'By Tal Pinchevsky', 'Perhaps the only thing more unusual than being a Mexican in Lithuania is being a Mexican hockey player in Lithuania.', 'So the general astonishment that has greeted Hector Majul since his arrival in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, in late November does not surprise him.', 'At 24, he is a forward for the Hockey Punks, one of four teams in the country’s largely unknown professional league. That move was another unforeseen step on an unconventional hockey path, which shifted when Majul was deported to Mexico during his college career in the United States.', '“He is an impressive skater,” said Boris Dorozhenko, Majul’s childhood coach and mentor. “The only problem for him was always his Mexican citizenship.”', 'Like a growing number of international athletes who want to pursue careers in the United States, Majul found that his immigration status — and what some view as suddenly stringent enforcement of technicalities — had become a major impediment. ', 'In a country that has long tried to attract athletes and artists with special talents, what once appeared to be a fairly clear path to at least semi-permanent residency has become a far more arduous road. The possibility of deportation can arise with just one unsatisfactory answer to an immigration official, whether spoken or written on a form.', 'In Majul’s case, an incorrect response a year and a half ago led to a dizzying journey back to Mexico, then on to Switzerland and now to Lithuania, with no promise of a return to the United States in the near future. ', 'Dorozhenko, who played hockey in the former Soviet Union, discovered a 6-year-old Majul in Mexico City after becoming a coach with the Mexican national program in the early 1990s.', 'Dorozhenko eventually landed a hockey job in Arizona, and Majul, 14 at the time, followed him. Because he was attending high school, Majul entered the United States with a student visa, then became a fixture at hockey clinics in the area, alongside a local standout named Auston Matthews. Drafted first over all by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2016, Matthews is now among the N.H.L.’s brightest stars. ', 'Majul was allowed to stay in the United States after high school, first on an amateur athlete visa, known as a P1, then on another student visa when he landed at Curry College in Massachusetts to play Division III hockey in 2015. ', 'By then he was a star for Mexico in international competition. In his first appearance in the International Ice Hockey Federation’s Division II Group B world championship tournament in 2014, he tied for the team’s scoring lead and helped Mexico finish one win shy of promotion to a higher division. He was named the tournament’s top forward in 2015 and again in 2016.', '“I know there have been professional players that have Mexican descent or Mexican parents,” Majul said, referring specifically to the N.H.L. (Matthews’s mother is from Mexico.) “But there has never been a Mexican-born pro hockey player. I want to be that guy.”', 'But on Aug. 22, 2017, as Majul returned to the United States from a trip home to see family, Customs and Border Protection officials at William P. Hobby Airport in Houston discovered a makeup box belonging to his girlfriend, Katy Weizman. An American, Weizman had accompanied Majul on the trip and returned to the United States the previous week. The makeup kit contained a week’s supply of Concerta, her A.D.H.D. medication and a controlled substance.', 'Majul said that the Houston Police Department had declined to further investigate his possession of the drug, but that he was detained and questioned that night and into the morning. According to an appeal filed by his lawyer, Majul told a customs agent that he had left Mexico “to pursue a career in ice hockey.” ', 'Based on this admission, Majul was found to have expressed an intention to violate the terms of his student visa. The visa was canceled, and he was deported after almost a decade of legally living and training in the United States. ', 'When contacted about this case, the Customs and Border Protection agency said in a statement that officers had found that Majul “provided differing answers when asked about his trip to the U.S. and the reason he departed his country of origin.” ', 'Majul’s lawyer submitted an appeal in September 2017, saying the officers had overreached in their decision. The appeal was denied. ', 'Marian Daugherty, who took Majul into her home when he first moved to the United States, set up a “Bring Hector Back” Facebook page and reached out to the office of then-Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, to no avail.', 'Majul was left to train in Mexico City, unable to return to the United States until 2022 and without the services of an agent. But with only 1,552 registered hockey players in Mexico, compared with more than 562,000 in the United States, Majul knew he would need to go elsewhere to keep up his game.', 'Majul and Dorozhenko canvassed their hockey network. Their search drew the attention of Arno Del Curto, who for 22 years had led the Davos hockey club in Switzerland. Equipped with a 90-day tourist visa, Majul ventured to Switzerland. Within three weeks, he was told that the team wanted him to stay.', '“It was a huge relief,” Majul said. “I’m going to be honest, I think I teared up a little bit when I talked to my parents.”', 'But immigration would again become a hurdle. To qualify for  certification, Majul needed to have been considered a professional before arriving in Switzerland. Because he had most recently played competitive hockey in college and  with the Mexican national team, he was deemed an amateur and denied a visa. The club in Davos appealed to the Swiss government, even offering to hire Majul as a skills coach in the hopes that might provide a legal workaround.', 'By November, with only five days remaining on his tourist visa and all his options exhausted, Majul went to train with a coach and former colleague of Dorozhenko’s in Serbia. Days later, he received an invitation to join Hockey Punks. ', 'The Lithuanian club signed Majul to a contract, provided an apartment in Vilnius and helped him stabilize his immigration status. In perhaps the most unexpected turn of this hockey escapade, Majul is not the only Mexican on the team. His countryman Arunas Bermejo joined the club while studying in Lithuania.', '“It’s a steppingstone, something to help me get to the next level,” Majul said. “Usually when people say they’re going to Europe, nobody thinks of Lithuania or Vilnius.”', 'He acknowledged that the transition to life in Vilnius was difficult, especially considering the abrupt nature of his arrival. But he has come to enjoy his new surroundings.', '“It’s actually a really nice town,” Majul said. “Great food, people are very friendly. I think the only downside is how cold it is.”', 'The average high temperature in Vilnius in February is 30 degrees — not frigid, unless your reference points are Mexico and Arizona.', 'Majul has been approved for worker certification that for the next year or two  will allow him to work within the Schengen Area, a region of 26 European nations, including Switzerland. That would make it easier for Majul to rejoin Davos for the 2019-20 season. (That hope was muddled when Del Curto announced his resignation in November.) ', 'Daugherty helped Majul enroll in online classes through Arizona State University, and he is working to complete his degree.', 'In his first professional game, on Dec. 22, a 5-2 loss to Kaunas, Majul registered an assist. In his first eight games with the club, Majul collected a goal and six assists. He has not given up on his pro hockey dreams, including a potential return to the United States.', '“I think in North America I have this label of, ‘Why is a Mexican playing hockey? He should be playing soccer,’” Majul said. “Don’t get me wrong. Here it’s also a shock when they hear there’s a Mexican hockey player. But after they see me playing, they see the level that I have, it kind of speaks for itself.”', '“I think that was maybe the way it had to go,” he added. “Maybe for me to be able to go on to the next level, I had to come and make it through here first.”', 'Advertisement', '', '', 'Advertisement', 'Supported by', 'By Gary Santaniello', 'WORCESTER, Mass. — The Holy Cross women’s ice hockey team averaged nearly 20 victories over the last 10 seasons while hanging six conference championship banners at its home rink, the Hart Center.', 'The senior tri-captains, Tori Messina, Julie Matthias and Sam Girard, helped the team win one of those banners, and the Crusaders posted a 62-17-3 record in their first three seasons.', '“We were so used to winning,” Messina, a defender, said.', 'But this season, the team’s first in Division I, Holy Cross has had to get used to losing.', 'It is 1-28-3 entering its final game on Friday night, at home against Providence. The other 34 Division I teams have each won at least two games.', 'The Crusaders have been shut out in 11 games and have been held to one goal in 14 others. They failed to score on their first 43 power-play opportunities after scoring at a 30 percent clip last season.', '“No team I’ve had has ever faced more challenges,” said Peter Van Buskirk, who has coached the program for 19 of its 20 years, taking over in its second season. Before that, he coached the Holy Cross men’s team for 10 seasons between 1979 and 1997, reaching the postseason eight times.', 'The former athletic director Nate Pine said it had always bothered him that women’s ice hockey was the only sport of the 27 at Holy Cross that was not playing in Division I. And when Holy Cross’s former league, the New England Hockey Conference, decided it wanted only Division III institutions as members, the college began looking for a new hockey home.', 'Pine, who left Holy Cross in January to become the athletic director at Air Force, approached the Hockey East commissioner, Joe Bertagna, whose league had an uneven number of women’s teams, nine, including top programs like Northeastern, Boston College and Boston University.', 'Holy Cross, with fewer than 3,000 students, committed to providing additional financial support for the program, and in May 2017 Hockey East announced that the Crusaders would join the league for the 2018-19 season.', '“As we continue to make investments over the next four, five years, we expect to be where we want to be,” Pine said in his final week at Holy Cross. “We’re not in this to be an also-ran.”', 'The news that Holy Cross would join Hockey East came just two months after North Dakota announced that it was dropping its women’s program, along with two other sports, for budgetary reasons. Before Holy Cross, the last new women’s program in Division I was Merrimack College’s, which joined Hockey East for the 2015-16 season.', 'Last September, L.I.U. Brooklyn said it would have a Division I team beginning in 2019-20, which would bring the number of those programs to 36 nationally. Northern Michigan is also exploring adding a women’s team. (There are 60 Division I men’s hockey teams.)', 'It is not unusual for a college team to struggle after moving up a division. Bertagna said he thought it was harder for a program to move up a level than to start a team from scratch. Compounding the difficulty for Holy Cross, it began this season with only one class that had been recruited for Division I competition.', 'Not only were returning Holy Cross players accustomed to winning, so were many of the incoming freshmen. Forward Carlie Magier won state championships for Belle Tire Hockey Club in Detroit, and goalie Jada Brenon won New York State titles while playing for the Nichols School in Buffalo.', '“This is a new challenge,” said Magier, who is tied for second on the team with 11 points. “I was looking forward to it. We expected to have bumps in the road.”', 'One of those bumps came against Connecticut on Oct. 13, when some teammates expressed frustration with one another on the bench as an early lead devolved into a 7-2 loss. It was addressed immediately after the game, and now, Brenon said, “This team gets together better than any team I’ve been on.”', 'Surprisingly, Holy Cross’s lone victory came Nov. 30 at home against Northeastern, which was ranked No. 5 at the time and is currently No. 3. Down by two goals in the first period, the Crusaders rallied for a 5-3 victory.', 'Matthias called it “the most fun hockey game I’ve ever played in.” She added, “We finally got what we’d been working for.”', 'Messina said she was crying on the bench as the game wound down. “I don’t think I breathed the last 10 minutes,” she said, laughing.', 'Before practice on Jan. 15, Van Buskirk, 76, told his team he would retire after the season. He said that he had begun thinking about retirement last year as he was preparing for his second hip replacement but that he relished the challenge of competing in Hockey East.', '“Our record this year doesn’t indicate how successful this journey has been for me and for the team,” he said. “They’ve been very good about focusing on the process, not the outcomes.”', 'Replacing him will be the associate head coach, Katie Lachapelle, who was hired in July 2017 after nine years as an assistant at Boston University. She has also coached national select teams for U.S.A. Hockey.', '“She’s brought a lot of Division I experience, and her exposure to U.S.A.

The possibility of deportation can arise with just one unsatisfactory answer to an immigration official, whether spoken or written on a form.', 'In Majul’s case, an incorrect response a year and a half ago led to a dizzying journey back to Mexico, then on to Switzerland and now to Lithuania, with no promise of a return to the United States in the near future. ', 'Dorozhenko, who played hockey in the former Soviet Union, discovered a 6-year-old Majul in Mexico City after becoming a coach with the Mexican national program in the early 1990s.', 'Dorozhenko eventually landed a hockey job in Arizona, and Majul, 14 at the time, followed him. Because he was attending high school, Majul entered the United States with a student visa, then became a fixture at hockey clinics in the area, alongside a local standout named Auston Matthews. Drafted first over all by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2016, Matthews is now among the N.H.L.’s brightest stars.

But he has come to enjoy his new surroundings.', '“It’s actually a really nice town,” Majul said. “Great food, people are very friendly. I think the only downside is how cold it is.”', 'The average high temperature in Vilnius in February is 30 degrees — not frigid, unless your reference points are Mexico and Arizona.', 'Majul has been approved for worker certification that for the next year or two  will allow him to work within the Schengen Area, a region of 26 European nations, including Switzerland. That would make it easier for Majul to rejoin Davos for the 2019-20 season. (That hope was muddled when Del Curto announced his resignation in November.)

The league championship game is the next weekend.', 'No matter what happens, the Whitecaps, a semiprofessional team founded in 2004, made their N.W.H.L. debut season an unqualified success. The league’s first expansion team and its first franchise outside the northeastern United States, the Whitecaps sold out all eight home games at Tria Rink, the practice facility for the N.H.L.’s Minnesota Wild, which has a capacity of 1,200. League officials say the Whitecaps are the first team in its four seasons to turn a profit.

In preteen hockey, only the most advanced players master it.', 'Curtis planned on attending college in Minnesota until Brown, her idol and mentor, suggested she check out New Hampshire while in that area for a tournament.', '“I went and visited, fell in love with the people and the campus, and never looked back,” Curtis said.', 'She broke her collarbone three times, which limited her to 15 games in her first two seasons.

Graduating in 2017 with a bioengineering degree, Curtis returned to Minnesota to work for a pharmaceutical company.', 'She signed up to play for a team called Minnesota Shenanigans in the Women’s Hockey Association of Minnesota, a popular Twin Cities recreational league. Long hours and weekend shifts at work limited her appearances, she said.', '“I wanted to start a career and wasn’t thinking too much about hockey,” she said. “But that year I wasn’t playing, I missed it. Hearing the Minnesota Whitecaps were going to be a thing, I got excited. I had to try out.”', 'Past connections helped.

Her best performance came Jan. 20 against Connecticut, with one goal and three assists in a 9-0 rout.', 'Coyne Schofield, who participated in the N.H.L.’s faster skater competition during All-Star weekend in January, is unquestionably the fleetest Whitecap.

She’s tricky. Doing one-on-ones, she can go in either direction very quickly. And her hands are so smooth that they don’t give anything away.”', 'A job change allowed Curtis a more flexible schedule to fit in weekend games and most practices.

After winning the American Hockey League’s Calder Cup last season, the Marlies are averaging more than 5,600 fans. The Furies have had several strong seasons, winning the championship as recently as 2014, yet the attendance remains so low that the league often reports it as a zero.', 'There have been significant advances recently in the Canadian Women’s Hockey League — which has a team in the United States (Worcester, Mass.) and one in China (Shenzhen).

She didn’t play her best tonight.’ We now have people at our practices, knowing the players, knowing what level they should be at.”', 'The Canadian Women’s Hockey League does not consistently report attendance figures.

The possibility of deportation can arise with just one unsatisfactory answer to an immigration official, whether spoken or written on a form.', 'In Majul’s case, an incorrect response a year and a half ago led to a dizzying journey back to Mexico, then on to Switzerland and now to Lithuania, with no promise of a return to the United States in the near future. ', 'Dorozhenko, who played hockey in the former Soviet Union, discovered a 6-year-old Majul in Mexico City after becoming a coach with the Mexican national program in the early 1990s.', 'Dorozhenko eventually landed a hockey job in Arizona, and Majul, 14 at the time, followed him. Because he was attending high school, Majul entered the United States with a student visa, then became a fixture at hockey clinics in the area, alongside a local standout named Auston Matthews. Drafted first over all by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2016, Matthews is now among the N.H.L.’s brightest stars. ', 'Majul was allowed to stay in the United States after high school, first on an amateur athlete visa, known as a P1, then on another student visa when he landed at Curry College in Massachusetts to play Division III hockey in 2015.

In his first appearance in the International Ice Hockey Federation’s Division II Group B world championship tournament in 2014, he tied for the team’s scoring lead and helped Mexico finish one win shy of promotion to a higher division. He was named the tournament’s top forward in 2015 and again in 2016.', '“I know there have been professional players that have Mexican descent or Mexican parents,” Majul said, referring specifically to the N.H.L.

I want to be that guy.”', 'But on Aug. 22, 2017, as Majul returned to the United States from a trip home to see family, Customs and Border Protection officials at William P. Hobby Airport in Houston discovered a makeup box belonging to his girlfriend, Katy Weizman. An American, Weizman had accompanied Majul on the trip and returned to the United States the previous week. The makeup kit contained a week’s supply of Concerta, her A.D.H.D. medication and a controlled substance.', 'Majul said that the Houston Police Department had declined to further investigate his possession of the drug, but that he was detained and questioned that night and into the morning. According to an appeal filed by his lawyer, Majul told a customs agent that he had left Mexico “to pursue a career in ice hockey.” ', 'Based on this admission, Majul was found to have expressed an intention to violate the terms of his student visa.

Within three weeks, he was told that the team wanted him to stay.', '“It was a huge relief,” Majul said. “I’m going to be honest, I think I teared up a little bit when I talked to my parents.”', 'But immigration would again become a hurdle. To qualify for  certification, Majul needed to have been considered a professional before arriving in Switzerland.

The club in Davos appealed to the Swiss government, even offering to hire Majul as a skills coach in the hopes that might provide a legal workaround.', 'By November, with only five days remaining on his tourist visa and all his options exhausted, Majul went to train with a coach and former colleague of Dorozhenko’s in Serbia. Days later, he received an invitation to join Hockey Punks. ', 'The Lithuanian club signed Majul to a contract, provided an apartment in Vilnius and helped him stabilize his immigration status. In perhaps the most unexpected turn of this hockey escapade, Majul is not the only Mexican on the team. His countryman Arunas Bermejo joined the club while studying in Lithuania.', '“It’s a steppingstone, something to help me get to the next level,” Majul said. “Usually when people say they’re going to Europe, nobody thinks of Lithuania or Vilnius.”', 'He acknowledged that the transition to life in Vilnius was difficult, especially considering the abrupt nature of his arrival. But he has come to enjoy his new surroundings.', '“It’s actually a really nice town,” Majul said. “Great food, people are very friendly. I think the only downside is how cold it is.”', 'The average high temperature in Vilnius in February is 30 degrees — not frigid, unless your reference points are Mexico and Arizona.', 'Majul has been approved for worker certification that for the next year or two  will allow him to work within the Schengen Area, a region of 26 European nations, including Switzerland.

She didn’t play her best tonight.’ We now have people at our practices, knowing the players, knowing what level they should be at.”', 'The Canadian Women’s Hockey League does not consistently report attendance figures.

By contrast, the average price for a single upper-bowl ticket at Scotiabank Arena for a Leafs regular-season game is 94 Canadian dollars.', 'The Leafs and the Furies started a partnership in 2012, in which the N.H.L. franchise invests 30,000 Canadian dollars annually in the Furies for equipment, uniforms and travel, and also to offset the costs of coaching. The club also invites the Furies to participate in various Leafs skills development clinics and youth programs, and the partnership expanded in 2015 to include the sale of Furies merchandise at the Leafs’ arena.', 'Small said that the partnership had also provided superior facilities for the Furies and that she had used them to help recruit players. “We have a great, dedicated dressing room,” she said. “We have a gym right there and a medical facility.”', 'Small, who played on a men’s hockey team at Stanford while working toward a degree in mechanical engineering, uses her home in Mississauga, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto, as her primary office, where she also handles administrative duties for her speaking career.', 'The Furies play weekend games and practice in Toronto from 9:15 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays — more frequently than any other C.W.H.L. team.

Yes. She’s constantly on the road.”', 'To help, Small made Wednesday practice optional. “When I think of Sami Jo, I think of how generous and approachable she is,” said Renata Fast, one of three Furies who played for Canada’s 2018 Olympic silver medalists. “She always makes time for that one-on-one connection.”', 'To raise money and build fan loyalty, Small offers skills clinics for women in recreational hockey leagues, charging them 50 Canadian dollars apiece to skate with the Furies.

She focuses her marketing on them, rather than on young girls working toward playing professionally. According to the Ontario Women’s Hockey Association, the province had 38,914 registered female players at all levels of the sport in 2017-18.', '“The reality is that most of the young female players in southern Ontario have tournaments every weekend,” Small said. “Their parents are carting them off from one rink to the next rink.

That move was another unforeseen step on an unconventional hockey path, which shifted when Majul was deported to Mexico during his college career in the United States.', '“He is an impressive skater,” said Boris Dorozhenko, Majul’s childhood coach and mentor. “The only problem for him was always his Mexican citizenship.”', 'Like a growing number of international athletes who want to pursue careers in the United States, Majul found that his immigration status — and what some view as suddenly stringent enforcement of technicalities — had become a major impediment. ', 'In a country that has long tried to attract athletes and artists with special talents, what once appeared to be a fairly clear path to at least semi-permanent residency has become a far more arduous road. The possibility of deportation can arise with just one unsatisfactory answer to an immigration official, whether spoken or written on a form.', 'In Majul’s case, an incorrect response a year and a half ago led to a dizzying journey back to Mexico, then on to Switzerland and now to Lithuania, with no promise of a return to the United States in the near future. ', 'Dorozhenko, who played hockey in the former Soviet Union, discovered a 6-year-old Majul in Mexico City after becoming a coach with the Mexican national program in the early 1990s.', 'Dorozhenko eventually landed a hockey job in Arizona, and Majul, 14 at the time, followed him. Because he was attending high school, Majul entered the United States with a student visa, then became a fixture at hockey clinics in the area, alongside a local standout named Auston Matthews. Drafted first over all by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2016, Matthews is now among the N.H.L.’s brightest stars. ', 'Majul was allowed to stay in the United States after high school, first on an amateur athlete visa, known as a P1, then on another student visa when he landed at Curry College in Massachusetts to play Division III hockey in 2015. ', 'By then he was a star for Mexico in international competition. In his first appearance in the International Ice Hockey Federation’s Division II Group B world championship tournament in 2014, he tied for the team’s scoring lead and helped Mexico finish one win shy of promotion to a higher division. He was named the tournament’s top forward in 2015 and again in 2016.', '“I know there have been professional players that have Mexican descent or Mexican parents,” Majul said, referring specifically to the N.H.L.

I want to be that guy.”', 'But on Aug. 22, 2017, as Majul returned to the United States from a trip home to see family, Customs and Border Protection officials at William P. Hobby Airport in Houston discovered a makeup box belonging to his girlfriend, Katy Weizman. An American, Weizman had accompanied Majul on the trip and returned to the United States the previous week. The makeup kit contained a week’s supply of Concerta, her A.D.H.D. medication and a controlled substance.', 'Majul said that the Houston Police Department had declined to further investigate his possession of the drug, but that he was detained and questioned that night and into the morning. According to an appeal filed by his lawyer, Majul told a customs agent that he had left Mexico “to pursue a career in ice hockey.” ', 'Based on this admission, Majul was found to have expressed an intention to violate the terms of his student visa. The visa was canceled, and he was deported after almost a decade of legally living and training in the United States. ', 'When contacted about this case, the Customs and Border Protection agency said in a statement that officers had found that Majul “provided differing answers when asked about his trip to the U.S. and the reason he departed his country of origin.” ', 'Majul’s lawyer submitted an appeal in September 2017, saying the officers had overreached in their decision. The appeal was denied.

Their search drew the attention of Arno Del Curto, who for 22 years had led the Davos hockey club in Switzerland. Equipped with a 90-day tourist visa, Majul ventured to Switzerland. Within three weeks, he was told that the team wanted him to stay.', '“It was a huge relief,” Majul said. “I’m going to be honest, I think I teared up a little bit when I talked to my parents.”', 'But immigration would again become a hurdle. To qualify for  certification, Majul needed to have been considered a professional before arriving in Switzerland. Because he had most recently played competitive hockey in college and  with the Mexican national team, he was deemed an amateur and denied a visa. The club in Davos appealed to the Swiss government, even offering to hire Majul as a skills coach in the hopes that might provide a legal workaround.', 'By November, with only five days remaining on his tourist visa and all his options exhausted, Majul went to train with a coach and former colleague of Dorozhenko’s in Serbia. Days later, he received an invitation to join Hockey Punks. ', 'The Lithuanian club signed Majul to a contract, provided an apartment in Vilnius and helped him stabilize his immigration status. In perhaps the most unexpected turn of this hockey escapade, Majul is not the only Mexican on the team. His countryman Arunas Bermejo joined the club while studying in Lithuania.', '“It’s a steppingstone, something to help me get to the next level,” Majul said. “Usually when people say they’re going to Europe, nobody thinks of Lithuania or Vilnius.”', 'He acknowledged that the transition to life in Vilnius was difficult, especially considering the abrupt nature of his arrival. But he has come to enjoy his new surroundings.', '“It’s actually a really nice town,” Majul said. “Great food, people are very friendly. I think the only downside is how cold it is.”', 'The average high temperature in Vilnius in February is 30 degrees — not frigid, unless your reference points are Mexico and Arizona.', 'Majul has been approved for worker certification that for the next year or two  will allow him to work within the Schengen Area, a region of 26 European nations, including Switzerland. That would make it easier for Majul to rejoin Davos for the 2019-20 season. (That hope was muddled when Del Curto announced his resignation in November.)

The possibility of deportation can arise with just one unsatisfactory answer to an immigration official, whether spoken or written on a form.', 'In Majul’s case, an incorrect response a year and a half ago led to a dizzying journey back to Mexico, then on to Switzerland and now to Lithuania, with no promise of a return to the United States in the near future. ', 'Dorozhenko, who played hockey in the former Soviet Union, discovered a 6-year-old Majul in Mexico City after becoming a coach with the Mexican national program in the early 1990s.', 'Dorozhenko eventually landed a hockey job in Arizona, and Majul, 14 at the time, followed him.

Drafted first over all by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2016, Matthews is now among the N.H.L.’s brightest stars.

The Whitecaps stars Lee Stecklein and Hannah Brandt, gold medalists for the 2018 United States Olympic team, appear on both. And the All-American mural includes one of the Whitecaps co-coaches, Ronda Curtin Engelhardt.', 'All were on the ice for a recent practice, with Engelhardt, 32, even joining her players for postgame sprints. But nothing in the arena acknowledges the Whitecaps’ leading scorer, Jonna Curtis, a left wing who was never a Golden Gopher, an Olympian or an All-American.', 'That the unheralded Curtis, 25, leads in the Whitecaps in goals (eight), assists (11) and points (19), rather than one of the team’s three Olympic gold medalists — wing Kendall Coyne Schofield is the third — illustrates the deep statewide talent pool. Minnesota was the first state to sanction girls high school hockey, in 1994. According to USA Hockey, more girls and women play hockey in Minnesota than any other state: close to 14,000 in 2017-18, the most recent season available.', '“I’m happy to be here on a team with most of the girls I grew up playing with,” Curtis said.', 'Last weekend, the Whitecaps, with 13 Minnesotans among 17 players in uniform, secured the N.W.H.L.’s regular-season championship with back-to-back victories at the Boston Pride and the Connecticut Whale. That also earned Minnesota (12-4-0, 24 points) the No. 1 seed and home ice throughout in the Isobel Cup playoffs.', 'Against Boston, the speedy Curtis scored the winning goal with 1 minute 42 seconds to play, crashing the net from the left and putting in a rebound for a 2-1 victory. Curtis finished tied for second in the league in points, one behind Hayley Scamurra of the Buffalo Beauts. Leaguewide, she outscored all seven forwards in the league who skated for the American team at the Pyeongchang Olympics.', '“It just shows how consistent she’s been all year,” Brandt said. “She started the year pretty strong and she hasn’t really let up, whereas the rest of us have kind of gone up and down a little.”', 'In a single-elimination semifinal on Sunday, the Whitecaps will face the Metropolitan Riveters. The league championship game is the next weekend.', 'No matter what happens, the Whitecaps, a semiprofessional team founded in 2004, made their N.W.H.L. debut season an unqualified success. The league’s first expansion team and its first franchise outside the northeastern United States, the Whitecaps sold out all eight home games at Tria Rink, the practice facility for the N.H.L.’s Minnesota Wild, which has a capacity of 1,200. League officials say the Whitecaps are the first team in its four seasons to turn a profit. Sunday’s game is also a sellout.', 'In the small circle of Twin Cities women’s hockey, Curtis is a familiar name. A two-time Minnesota Ms. Hockey finalist in high school — she, Stecklein and Brandt were up for the award in 2012, with Brandt winning — Curtis holds Elk River High career records with 280 points and 124 assists. All three attended summer youth hockey camps run by Winny Brodt Brown, the Whitecaps’ captain. Engelhardt was among the instructors.', '“We knew each other pretty well,” Stecklein said. “I remember hearing about this girl who was really good, had really good hands and had a toe pull that beat just about every team.”', 'A toe pull is a stickhandling move, also known as a toe drag, where the puck carrier pulls the puck toward them with the toe of the blade to avoid a defender. In preteen hockey, only the most advanced players master it.', 'Curtis planned on attending college in Minnesota until Brown, her idol and mentor, suggested she check out New Hampshire while in that area for a tournament.', '“I went and visited, fell in love with the people and the campus, and never looked back,” Curtis said.', 'She broke her collarbone three times, which limited her to 15 games in her first two seasons. But she gained a year back through a medical redshirt and led New Hampshire in points her final three seasons without missing a game. Her 21 goals as a senior earned her first-team all-Hockey East.', 'But the Wildcats never posted a winning record during her time, and USA Hockey never chose her for an age-group national team or international competition. Graduating in 2017 with a bioengineering degree, Curtis returned to Minnesota to work for a pharmaceutical company.', 'She signed up to play for a team called Minnesota Shenanigans in the Women’s Hockey Association of Minnesota, a popular Twin Cities recreational league. Long hours and weekend shifts at work limited her appearances, she said.', '“I wanted to start a career and wasn’t thinking too much about hockey,” she said. “But that year I wasn’t playing, I missed it. Hearing the Minnesota Whitecaps were going to be a thing, I got excited. I had to try out.”', 'Past connections helped. The Whitecaps founder Jack Brodt, Brown’s father, was a Whitecaps’ co-coach and the general manager. Engelhardt left her coaching job at The Breck School in suburban Minneapolis to join Brodt, a neighbor from Roseville, Minn., on the bench.', 'No one had forgotten the fast-skating girl with the soft hands. “She was always in our loop,” Engelhardt said.', 'Teamed with center Katie McGovern from Minnesota Duluth and right wing Kate Schipper from Minnesota on the team’s No. 2 line, Curtis had at least one point in each game of Minnesota’s season-opening five-game winning streak. Her best performance came Jan. 20 against Connecticut, with one goal and three assists in a 9-0 rout.', 'Coyne Schofield, who participated in the N.H.L.’s faster skater competition during All-Star weekend in January, is unquestionably the fleetest Whitecap. But the 5-foot-4 Curtis is not far behind, Brandt said.', 'Stecklein remembered an early-season race-to-the-puck drill between Curtis and Allie Thunstrom, a three-time Hockey East selection from Boston College and a former speedskater, being neck-and-neck.', '“We have the fastest team, and she’s right up there,” Stecklein said. “She’s shifty. She’s tricky. Doing one-on-ones, she can go in either direction very quickly. And her hands are so smooth that they don’t give anything away.”', 'A job change allowed Curtis a more flexible schedule to fit in weekend games and most practices. Curtis shares an apartment with her Whitecaps teammates Margo Lund and Sadie Lundquist. Skating on a winning team with three Olympians and so many faces from her Minnesota hockey upbringing thrills Curtis, who thought her best hockey memories were behind her.', '“I’m happy to just be playing again,” she said. “I always dreamed of being in the Olympics, because that was the only thing you could do after college when I was young.

Minnesota, a five-time national champion, missed the 16-team tournament for the second time in three seasons.', 'And the balance of power continues to shift. St. Cloud State (27-4-3) remained atop both national polls this week, with Minnesota Duluth (21-11-2) fourth. Minnesota State (29-7-2) is second in one poll and third in the other.

Minnesota may need to win the Big Ten tournament for an automatic bid this weekend to avoid another N.C.A.A. miss.', '“We’re at the beginning stages of putting our footprint down,” Motzko said. “I know I’m taking over one of the most storied programs in the history of college hockey. There’s nothing holding us back except for ourselves.”', 'The change in Minnesota reflects a nationwide trend of newer programs usurping traditional powers.

It hasn’t gone unnoticed that two members of Bemidji State’s 2009 Frozen Four team, Matt Read and Brad Hunt, play for the Minnesota Wild.', '“In the day, Minnesota used to take whoever they wanted,” said Brett Larson, the former Minnesota Duluth assistant coach who succeeded Motzko as coach of the St. Cloud Huskies. “Now these kids know there are four other great options out there, and they can find the one that fits them — not just as a hockey player, but as a person too.”', 'St. Cloud, Minnesota Duluth, Bemidji State and Minnesota State share much in common.

A young Motzko, a former St. Cloud player, took his first coaching job as one of Brooks’s assistants. Brooks helped the university secure arena funding before leaving to coach the Minnesota North Stars.', '“Herb Brooks’s vision of getting St. Cloud State to the Division I level was to create more opportunities for kids in the state to be able to play at that level,” said Larson, who grew up in Duluth. “That was the turning point.

The Huskies made eight N.C.A.A. tournament appearances in Motzko’s 13 seasons.', 'Reaching the Frozen Four in 2013, and joining the new National Collegiate Hockey Conference the following season, raised St. Cloud’s national profile.

Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.', 'A year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.', 'The result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.', 'But critics saw few systemic changes.', '“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.', 'A history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.', '“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”', 'And that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.', 'Students in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.', 'Smith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)', 'More righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.', 'His class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.', '“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.', 'Smith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.', 'While Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.', '“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”', 'Smith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.', 'Within three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.', 'That summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.', 'Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)', '“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.', 'Smith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.', 'Southall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.', '“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.', 'To hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”', '“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”', 'Ally Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”', 'Her days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.', '“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”', 'Still, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course.

One reason? Examples like Tunica, Miss.', 'By Timothy Williams', 'TUNICA, Miss. — As he drove through town in his black Crown Victoria, Chuck Cariker, the mayor of Tunica, pointed out the gifts that he said gambling had bestowed upon his town. The town hall. The recreation center. The post office. The police station. The roads. Even the car. ', 'When Mr. Cariker says “gambling put us on the map,” it is only modest overstatement. ', 'But in recent years, the Tunica area’s aging casinos have struggled to fend off competition from local rivals and failed to attract young people. Casinos have closed. Residents have moved away.', 'Then last year, town leaders got new hope when Mississippi became one of the first states to allow sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a law that had effectively banned it in most states. ', 'The vast majority of states have shied away from permitting such gambling and tapping into the nation’s illegal sports gambling market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. But in places like Tunica, where people began legally betting on sports in August, the results, so far, have been underwhelming. ', 'The reluctance of state lawmakers, gambling analysts say, is based on a growing consensus that legal sports betting may not bring the windfall that economic forecasters predicted only a few months ago.', '“There were a lot of people who didn’t know what they were talking about,” said Allen Godfrey, the executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, which oversees the sports betting ventures around Tunica.', 'Since the Supreme Court’s decision last May, which raised the prospect of hundreds of millions in new tax revenue, just six states have given final approval to allow legal sports betting. In a seventh state, New Mexico, Native American tribes have begun offering sports betting with federal approval.', 'In all, about a dozen states are considering sports gambling bills. But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.', 'West Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.', 'Rhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.', 'New Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting. ', 'The nation’s three most populous states — California, Florida and Texas — have dropped plans to legalize sports betting for many reasons, including worries about undercutting Native American tribes that operate casinos.', 'Tribal officials say legal sports betting will cut into their gambling profits, and ultimately reduce the money their casinos send to state governments each year. Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.', 'A year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.', 'The area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue. As part of a complex formula worked out between the casinos and the state, the town receives a percentage of revenue earned by the casinos. ', 'Along Tunica’s Main Street, there is a bank, a grocery and an antique shop alongside a few empty storefronts. The residential sections include well-tended homes shaded by oak trees, but also tiny shotgun shacks.', 'Before casinos arrived in 1993, the unemployment rate in Tunica County was more than 26 percent. And when the town of Tunica was known by outsiders, it was for an embarrassing relic of its past — an open sewer called Sugar Ditch, which ran through town. “60 Minutes” once documented the poverty.', 'But legalized gambling brought change. ', 'Cotton and rice fields were transformed into casinos. Raw sewage stopped flowing into Sugar Ditch. The town began to modernize.', 'Early on, tourists waited for up to four hours outside casinos. Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.', 'At the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw. As recently as 2006, Tunica’s casinos took in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.', 'But within a few years, people began to stay away. The largest casino, Harrah’s Tunica, closed in 2014. Nearly 1,000 people lost their jobs. Retail stores in the area soon closed, too. ', 'As the revenue stream from casinos shrunk, so did the town’s budget. The annual budget for the town of Tunica was about $5 million in 2009. This year, it was $3.5 million.', 'The effect has been devastating: The county’s poverty rate — particularly among African-Americans — has crept up. Over the past decade, the number of workers employed by the town has decreased to 34 from 65.', 'Some residents have long been skeptical about the morality of gambling. Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.', 'Mr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.', '“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” ', 'Sports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.', 'But in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.', 'So far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.', 'In all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now. Competition has cropped up from a gambling complex in Arkansas.', '“A lot of things happened at the same time, and unfortunately, Tunica got caught in the middle,” Mr. Godfrey said.', 'On a recent weekday afternoon, only a trickle of people came to bet on the games at the Horseshoe Tunica, where employees recording sports wagers were dressed in referee uniforms. There were offerings for baseball, hockey, Nascar, boxing, Major League Soccer, the Bundesliga, and the Masters Golf Tournament. Most people were making small bets of $10 or so. ', 'Pete Polkowski, 68 and from Iowa, came to bet on the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and decided to stay a few extra days in the casino’s hotel to try his luck at other sports. He was fixated on a television set showing an early season game between the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. No one else was watching.', '“I come in the morning, look at the betting lines, go back to my hotel room and study for a couple of hours,” he said. His strategy, he said, had paid off, though he declined to say how much he had won. ', ' ', 'R. Scott Barber, regional president of Caesars Mid-South and chairman of the Tunica Tourism Commission, acknowledged that the crowds the casinos had hoped for had not materialized. But he said it was premature to judge whether sports betting had been a failure. Mr. Barber said there had been some positive signs, including a group that had driven five hours from St. Louis to bet on a St. Louis Cardinals game.', '“We’re fairly pleased early on,” he said. “It takes time. We’re starting to see some growth for the first time in 10 years, so I think the market has bottomed out and sports betting will help drive that growth.”', 'Many gamblers never make it to Tunica’s downtown shops, and Mr. Cariker says he is still devising ways to get them to visit and spend money.', '“My job is to bring them 10 minutes south to see what we have in town,” he said.

In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams.

Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).', 'In a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).', 'The good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise.

Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.', 'After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.', 'Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.', 'Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.', 'Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.', 'Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque.

Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.', 'Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.', 'Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts.

More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\", 'The W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”', 'When Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”', 'Ms. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. ', 'Before finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).', 'In a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).', 'The good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)', 'Ms. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”', 'When possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.', 'Although many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.', 'After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.', 'Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.', 'Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.', 'Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.', 'Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.', 'Hook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.', 'Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.', 'Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.', 'If you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).', 'Look for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit.

A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.', 'Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor.

After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.

In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams.

Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes.

But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.', 'Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)', '“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.', 'Smith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.', 'Southall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.', '“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.', 'To hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”', '“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”', 'Ally Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”', 'Her days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time.

Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.', 'Rhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.', 'New Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago.

Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.', 'At the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw.

Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.', 'Mr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.', '“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” ', 'Sports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.', 'But in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business. Four hundred more jobs vanished.', 'So far, sports betting revenue has brought in only half of what Tunica officials had expected. State tax revenue from Tunica’s casinos, about $630 million annually, is just a fraction of what it once was.', 'In all, some 14,000 people worked in the area’s casinos in 2001 compared with 4,300 now.

', 'Here are other cases where pay inequality has been stark, compelling female athletes to speak out.', 'The U.S. Open. After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since. Other Grand Slams, though, were slow to follow suit.', '[READ MORE: Eight Times Women in Sports Fought for Equality]', \"The Australian Open, and other Grand Slams. Prize money for the Australian Open had fluctuated for decades: In 1978, the men’s winner was paid about 585 percent more than the women’s, ESPN reported last year. And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women's Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\", 'The W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”', 'When Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”', 'Ms. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. ', 'Before finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).', 'In a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).', 'The good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)', 'Ms. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”', 'When possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.', 'Although many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.', 'After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.', 'Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.', 'Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.', 'Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.', 'Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.', 'Hook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.', 'Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.', 'Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.', 'If you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).', 'Look for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit.

These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.', 'The result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program.

A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.', 'Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor.

Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes.

They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.', 'Combination bras offer aspects of both designs.

These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.', 'The result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.', 'But critics saw few systemic changes.', '“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.', 'A history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.', '“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”', 'And that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.', 'Students in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.', 'Smith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)', 'More righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.', 'His class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.', '“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.', 'Smith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.', 'While Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.', '“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”', 'Smith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.', 'Within three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.', 'That summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.', 'Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)', '“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.', 'Smith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.', 'Southall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.', '“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.', 'To hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”', '“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”', 'Ally Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”', 'Her days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.', '“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”', 'Still, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course.

But lawmakers and gambling analysts say only two or three of those states are likely to approve sports betting this legislative session, in part because of disappointing experiences in states where betting was recently made legal.', 'West Virginia, for instance, has collected only one-fourth of the monthly tax revenue it projected. Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only about half of the tax revenue they had anticipated, according to data from those states.', 'Rhode Island has done even worse: State budget officials had assumed that sports betting would bring in nearly $1 million a month, but only about $50,000 is coming in each month.', 'New Jersey, however, has been a bright spot. The state has brought in more than $2 billion since sports betting was legalized about 10 months ago. The vast majority of the bets there have come from smartphones or online, not allowed in most of the other states that have recently approved sports betting.

Those funds have become crucial revenue sources for states including California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan and Minnesota.', 'A year after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the disappointing results of sports betting have perhaps been felt nowhere more profoundly than in Tunica, a Mississippi Delta town of about 900 residents that had once been among the poorest places in the nation in terms of per capita income.', 'The area’s seven casinos sit just outside town limits, but they play an outsize role in nearly every aspect of daily life in Tunica, including providing two-thirds of the town’s annual revenue.

Highway 61 from Memphis had to be widened to four lanes. Charter jets began arriving at the airport, and the runways were lengthened.', 'At the time, Mississippi trailed only Nevada and New Jersey as a gambling destination, and the Tunica area’s shiny new casinos were the big draw.

Some pastors tell parishioners that the gamblers helping to save the town are committing a sin.', 'Mr. Cariker, who said he does not gamble, said Tunica has long held a dual nature — rural, religious and conservative, but also inexorably tied to gambling.', '“It’s strange being mayor of a town where people are dead set against it, but we’re dependent on gambling, in the middle of the Bible Belt,” he said. “The casinos brought something to Tunica to get us out of a hole.” ', 'Sports betting, which Mississippi began to allow in August, fueled new optimism in Tunica.', 'But in January, only months into Tunica’s foray into sports betting, the casino at the Tunica Roadhouse, owned by Caesars Entertainment, closed because of a lack of business.

After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal.

In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”', 'When Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”', 'Ms. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. ', 'Before finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).', 'In a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).', 'The good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit.

If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.', 'Although many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.', 'After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.', 'Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.', 'Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.', 'Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.', 'Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.', 'Hook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.', 'Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.', 'Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.', 'If you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).', 'Look for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit.

Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.', 'After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.', 'Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.', 'Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.', 'Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.', 'Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.', 'Hook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.', 'Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.', 'Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.', 'If you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).', 'Look for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.', 'Sign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday.

These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.', 'The result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program.

A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.', 'Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)', '“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.', 'Smith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.', 'Southall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.', '“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.', 'To hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him.

This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market.

After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal.

In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”', 'When Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”', 'Ms. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. ', 'Before finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).', 'In a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).', 'The good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit.

If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.', 'Although many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.', 'After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.', 'Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.', 'Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.', 'Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.', 'Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.', 'Hook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.', 'Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.', 'Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.', 'If you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).', 'Look for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”', 'When Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”', 'Ms. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. ', 'Before finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).', 'In a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).', 'The good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)', 'Ms. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”', 'When possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.', 'Although many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.', 'After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.', 'Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.', 'Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.', 'Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.', 'Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.', 'Hook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.', 'Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.', 'Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.', 'If you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).', 'Look for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit.

These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.', 'The result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program.

The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)', 'More righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.', 'His class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.', '“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.', 'Smith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.', 'While Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.', '“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”', 'Smith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.', 'Within three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.', 'That summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.', 'Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)', '“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.', 'Smith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.', 'Southall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.', '“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.', 'To hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him.

It is a whole new way of experiencing sports.”', 'Last May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created — almost overnight — a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate.', 'On the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors.

This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday’s Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market.

After long-fought battles by champions like Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Venus and Serena Williams, tennis has seen the most progress when it comes to pay equity.  The first real appeal was made in 1970 by King, after a tournament in Italy for which she was paid just $600 for taking the women’s title. The men’s winner was awarded $3,500. King would later make this statement: “Everyone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.”In 1973, King threatened to sit out the U.S. Open unless the prize money was made equal. It worked. That year, the men’s and women’s champions were paid equally, and the U.S. Open has paid its winners equally since.

And in the mid-1980s, the women’s winner was paid slightly more. By the mid-1990s, men were again paid more, prompting officials in the Women's Tennis Association to push hard for equal pay. In 2001, the Australian Open agreed, and winners have been compensated equally since. The French Open came around in 2006, and then Wimbledon in 2007, a change led by Venus Williams. Williams made a failed plea to Wimbledon’s governing body the night before she took the title in 2005. And in 2006, she wrote an op-ed in The Times of London titled “Wimbledon Has Sent Me a Message: I’m Only a Second Class Champion.” In 2007, she was awarded $1.4 million for her victory, the same as the men’s champion, Roger Federer. More recently, Novak Djokovic, currently the No. 1 men’s player in the world, suggested men deserve more money. “The stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men’s tennis matches,” he said in 2016. “I think that’s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more.”\", 'The W.N.B.A. When compared with the N.B.A., athletes in the W.N.B.A. face extreme pay disparities — though, as is often pointed out, the N.B.A. is a multibillion dollar industry, while the W.N.B.A. is not. Nonetheless, in 2018, the W.N.B.A. set an individual salary cap of $117,500, and rookies earned a minimum of about $50,000.

In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”', 'When Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”', 'Ms. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. ', 'Before finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).', 'In a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).', 'The good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit.

If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.', 'Although many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.', 'After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.', 'Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.', 'Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.', 'Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.', 'Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.', 'Hook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.', 'Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.', 'Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.', 'If you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).', 'Look for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit.
